# Architecture Decisions

This file tracks key architectural and technical decisions made during development.

## Decision Template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - [Decision Title]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

**Context**:
What is the issue we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

**Decision**:
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

**Consequences**:
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```

## Decisions

### 2024-01-01 - Adopt Hodge Development Framework

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
We need a consistent development workflow that balances rapid prototyping with production quality. The team struggles with when to write tests, how strict to be with types, and when to refactor.

**Decision**:
Adopt the Hodge framework with its four-phase development model: Explore → Build → Harden → Ship. This provides clear guidelines for code quality expectations at each phase.

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Clear expectations for code quality at each phase
- **Positive**: Faster initial development in explore mode
- **Positive**: Systematic quality improvement through phases
- **Negative**: Learning curve for the team
- **Negative**: Need to track which phase code is in

### 2024-01-01 - Progressive Testing Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
Writing comprehensive tests upfront slows down exploration and experimentation. However, shipping without tests is risky. We need a balanced approach.

**Decision**:
Implement progressive testing:
- **Explore**: No tests required, only test intentions
- **Build**: Smoke tests for happy path
- **Harden**: Integration tests for edge cases
- **Ship**: Full behavioral test coverage

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Faster exploration and prototyping
- **Positive**: Tests written when design is stable
- **Positive**: Focus on behavior, not implementation
- **Negative**: Risk of forgetting to add tests later
- **Negative**: Potential tech debt in explore phase

### 2024-01-01 - Type Safety Progression

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
Strict TypeScript types during exploration phase creates friction. However, production code needs type safety for reliability.

**Decision**:
Allow `any` types in explore mode, enforce strict types in harden/ship modes. Use TypeScript inference instead of explicit return types.

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Faster prototyping in explore mode
- **Positive**: Type safety in production code
- **Positive**: Less verbose code with inference
- **Negative**: Need to fix types before shipping
- **Negative**: Risk of type-related bugs in early phases

## Example Decisions for Your Project

Below are templates for common architectural decisions. Customize or remove as needed:

### YYYY-MM-DD - Database Selection

**Status**: Proposed

**Context**:
[Why do you need to choose a database? What are the requirements?]

**Decision**:
[Which database and why?]

**Consequences**:
[What are the trade-offs?]

---

### YYYY-MM-DD - API Architecture Style

**Status**: Proposed

**Context**:
[REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC? What are your needs?]

**Decision**:
[Which style and why?]

**Consequences**:
[What are the implications?]

---

### YYYY-MM-DD - Testing Framework

**Status**: Proposed

**Context**:
[What testing needs do you have?]

**Decision**:
[Which framework and why?]

**Consequences**:
[What changes about your testing approach?]

---

### YYYY-MM-DD - State Management

**Status**: Proposed

**Context**:
[For frontend: Redux vs Context vs Zustand? For backend: in-memory vs Redis?]

**Decision**:
[Which approach and why?]

**Consequences**:
[How does this affect development?]

## Decision Guidelines

1. **Record decisions promptly** - Document while context is fresh
2. **Include alternatives considered** - Show your thinking process
3. **Link to relevant code** - Reference implementations
4. **Review regularly** - Revisit decisions quarterly
5. **Update status** - Mark deprecated decisions
6. **Keep it concise** - One page max per decision

## Reviewing Decisions

Every quarter, review decisions and ask:
- Is this still valid?
- What have we learned?
- Should we reconsider?
- Are consequences as expected?

Mark outdated decisions as "Deprecated" or "Superseded" rather than deleting them.

*Decisions are experiments. Be willing to change course when you learn something new.*
