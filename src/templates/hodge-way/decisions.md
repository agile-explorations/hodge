## Decision Guidelines

1. **Record decisions promptly** - Document while context is fresh
2. **Include alternatives considered** - Show your thinking process
3. **Link to relevant code** - Reference implementations
4. **Review regularly** - Revisit decisions quarterly
5. **Update status** - Mark deprecated decisions
6. **Keep it concise** - One page max per decision

## Reviewing Decisions

Every quarter, review decisions and ask:
- Is this still valid?
- What have we learned?
- Should we reconsider?
- Are consequences as expected?

Mark outdated decisions as "Deprecated" or "Superseded" rather than deleting them.

*Decisions are experiments. Be willing to change course when you learn something new.*
