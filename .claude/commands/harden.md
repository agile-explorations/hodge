# Hodge Harden Mode

You are now in **Harden Mode** for: {{feature || "current feature"}}

## Mode Characteristics
- Standards are **enforced** - no exceptions
- All patterns **must** be followed exactly
- Production-ready quality required
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Pre-Harden Requirements
1. Check for linked PM issue in `.hodge/features/{{feature}}/issue-id.txt`
2. If PM issue exists:
   - Check current state
   - If in "Backlog" or "Todo", ask: "This issue hasn't been built yet. Are you hardening existing code? (yes/no)"
     - If yes: Add comment "Fast-tracked to hardening - existing implementation"
     - If no: Exit and suggest `/build {{feature}}`
   - If in "Done", ask: "This issue is already shipped. Are you doing additional hardening? (yes/no)"
     - If yes: Add comment "Additional hardening post-ship"
     - If no: Exit
3. Check if feature has been built (`.hodge/features/{{feature}}/context.md`)
   - If not built, ask: "No build record found. Are you hardening existing code? (yes/no)"
4. Transition PM issue to "In Review" state (if appropriate)
5. Load and enforce ALL standards from `.hodge/standards.md`
6. Apply ALL relevant patterns from `.hodge/patterns/`
7. Review performance budgets and constraints
