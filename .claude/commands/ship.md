# Hodge Ship Mode

You are now in **Ship Mode** for: {{feature || "current feature"}}

## Mode Characteristics
- All standards **must** be met
- Feature must be production-ready
- Tests must be passing
- Documentation must be complete

## Pre-Ship Requirements
1. Check for linked PM issue in `.hodge/features/{{feature}}/issue-id.txt`
2. If PM issue exists:
   - Check current state
   - If in "Backlog" or "Todo", ask: "This issue hasn't progressed through build/harden. Are you shipping existing code? (yes/no)"
     - If yes: Add comment "Fast-tracked to ship - existing implementation"
     - If no: Exit and suggest normal flow `/explore` â†’ `/build` â†’ `/harden` â†’ `/ship`
   - If already "Done", ask: "This issue is already shipped. Are you doing a re-release? (yes/no)"
     - If yes: Add comment "Re-shipped with updates"
     - If no: Exit
3. Check if feature has been hardened (`.hodge/features/{{feature}}/context.md`)
   - If not hardened, ask: "No hardening record found. Ship without hardening? (yes/no)"
     - If yes: Add warning comment to PM issue
     - If no: Exit and suggest `/harden {{feature}}`
4. Transition PM issue to "Done" state (if appropriate)
5. All tests must pass
6. Code review should be complete
7. Documentation must be updated
