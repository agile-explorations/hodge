# Hodge Plan - Work Organization & PM Integration

## Purpose
The `/plan` command transforms technical decisions into organized, executable work. It handles epic/story breakdown, dependency analysis, parallel lane allocation, and PM tool integration.

## Command Execution
```bash
hodge plan {{feature}}
```

Options:
```bash
hodge plan {{feature}} --lanes 3        # Specify number of development lanes
hodge plan {{feature}} --local-only     # Skip PM tool integration
```

## Workflow Position
```
/explore â†’ /decide â†’ /plan â†’ /build
    â†‘         â†‘        â†‘        â†‘
 Investigate  Record  Organize  Implement
            Decisions   Work
```

## What This Command Does

### 1. Analyzes Decisions
- Reads decisions from `.hodge/decisions.md`
- Identifies work units from technical choices
- Determines complexity (single story vs epic)

### 2. Generates Work Breakdown
- Creates stories with effort estimates
- Identifies dependencies between stories
- Proposes epic structure when appropriate

### 3. Allocates to Development Lanes
- Distributes work across parallel tracks
- Respects dependency chains
- Optimizes for minimal blocking

### 4. Creates PM Structure
- Creates epics and stories in PM tool
- Sets up parent/child relationships
- Maps IDs for tracking

## Configuration

Add to `hodge.json`:
```json
{
  "planning": {
    "developmentLanes": 3,        // Number of parallel tracks
    "laneNames": [                // Optional custom names
      "backend",
      "frontend",
      "infrastructure"
    ],
    "autoAssignDependencies": true,
    "defaultStorySize": "medium"
  }
}
```

## Interactive Planning Process

### Step 1: Complexity Analysis
The AI analyzes decisions to determine if the feature needs:
- **Single Story**: Simple implementation (1-3 days)
- **Epic with Stories**: Complex feature requiring breakdown

### Step 2: Story Generation
For epics, the AI identifies stories based on:
- Technical areas mentioned in decisions
- Natural work boundaries
- Testing requirements
- Dependencies between components

### Step 3: Dependency Analysis
```
Example Dependency Graph:
Database Schema (296.1) â†’ User Service (296.2) â†’ Auth API (296.3)
                                               â†˜
                                                  Frontend (296.4)
                                               â†—
Session Store (296.5) â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’
```

### Step 4: Lane Allocation
Work is distributed to maximize parallelism:
```
Lane 1: Backend Core
  Day 1: Database schema (296.1)
  Day 2-3: User service (296.2)

Lane 2: Infrastructure (can start immediately)
  Day 1-2: Session store (296.5)
  Day 3: Available for next story

Lane 3: API/Frontend (starts after 296.1)
  Day 2-3: Auth API (296.3)
  Day 4-5: Frontend (296.4)
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Planning
```
$ hodge plan HODGE-296

ðŸ“‹ Planning Work Structure

Analyzing 3 decisions for HODGE-296...

Development Plan
================
Feature: HODGE-296
Type: epic

Stories (5):
  HODGE-296.1: Database schema and migrations (Lane 1)
  HODGE-296.2: API implementation [depends on: HODGE-296.1] (Lane 1)
  HODGE-296.3: Frontend components [depends on: HODGE-296.2] (Lane 2)
  HODGE-296.4: Tests and validation [depends on: all] (Lane 3)
  HODGE-296.5: Documentation (Lane 2)

Lane Allocation (3 lanes):
  Lane 1: HODGE-296.1, HODGE-296.2
  Lane 2: HODGE-296.3, HODGE-296.5
  Lane 3: HODGE-296.4

Estimated Timeline: 4 days
================

âœ“ Created epic with 5 stories in Linear
âœ“ Plan saved to .hodge/development-plan.json

Next Steps:

Parallel development ready:
  Lane 1: hodge build HODGE-296.1
  Lane 2: hodge build HODGE-296.5
  Lane 3: (wait for dependencies)
```

### Single Developer Mode
```
$ hodge plan HODGE-297 --lanes 1

ðŸ“‹ Planning Work Structure

Development Plan
================
Feature: HODGE-297
Type: epic

Stories in sequence:
  1. HODGE-297.1: Core implementation
  2. HODGE-297.2: Tests
  3. HODGE-297.3: Documentation

Estimated Timeline: 5 days
================

Next Steps:
  Start with: hodge build HODGE-297.1
```

## Benefits Over Previous Approach

### Before (in `/decide`)
- Mixed concerns: decisions + work planning
- No dependency analysis
- No parallel development support
- Confusing workflow

### After (with `/plan`)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Smart dependency management
- Parallel lane optimization
- Clear workflow progression

## Team Development

The `/plan` command enables effective team collaboration:

1. **Developer A** works Lane 1 (backend)
2. **Developer B** works Lane 2 (frontend)
3. **Developer C** works Lane 3 (testing/infrastructure)

All developers can see:
- What they can work on now
- What's blocking them
- When dependencies will be ready

## Solo Development

Even for solo developers, `/plan` provides value:
- Clear work sequence
- Dependency visibility
- Progress tracking
- Realistic time estimates

## Next Steps After Planning

```
### What would you like to do?
a) Start building first story â†’ `/build {{first_story}}`
b) Review plan details â†’ `cat .hodge/development-plan.json`
c) Modify plan â†’ `/plan {{feature}} --lanes N`
d) View dependencies â†’ `hodge status {{feature}}`
e) Continue to build phase
f) Done for now

Your choice:
```

## Important Notes

- The `/plan` command should be run AFTER `/decide`
- Plans can be regenerated if decisions change
- PM tool integration is optional (--local-only)
- Lane allocation respects dependencies automatically
- Stories can be worked on independently within constraints

Remember: `/plan` bridges the gap between decisions and implementation, turning ideas into actionable, parallel work streams.
