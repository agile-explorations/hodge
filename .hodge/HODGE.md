# HODGE.md

This file provides AI assistants with context about the current Hodge workflow state.

## Current Status
**Feature**: general
**Mode**: explore
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-20T18:28:15.868Z
## Current Session
**Resumed**: 23 minutes ago
**Progress**: Explored HODGE-130 with 1 approaches
**Working on**: HODGE-130 (explore mode)
## AI Context Restoration
You were helping with HODGE-130. Explored HODGE-130 with 1 approaches
Suggested next: Review exploration and decide with 'hodge decide'
## Core Principles

- **1. AI-Backend Separation**: - **AI (Claude) Role**: Intellectual work - analysis, extraction, design, proposals

## Recent Decisions

- **2025-09-18**: Implement Context-Aware Workflow Commands using Implicit Context Reading approach - commands will automatically read from context
- **2025-09-18**: Use Implicit Context Reading approach for context-aware workflow commands - commands will read from context
- **2025-09-18**: Implement Event-Based Auto-Save approach for HODGE-052: auto-save context through command interceptor pattern that wraps feature commands, providing transparent auto-save with minimal code changes
- **2025-09-18**: HODGE-003 is production-ready despite project-wide lint issues - the feature extraction code itself has no lint errors, all tests pass, and the functionality is complete
- **2025-09-18**: Implement formal feature closure workflow: /close command or closure option in /ship to properly transition features to closed state with reasons

## Active Standards

### Core Standards
- TypeScript with strict mode
- ESLint rules enforced
- Prettier formatting

### Code Comments and TODOs
- **TODO Convention**: Always use `// TODO:` comments for incomplete work
- - Format: `// TODO: [phase] description`
- - Examples:
- - `// TODO: Add error handling before ship`
- - `// TODO: Implement caching for performance`
- - `// TODO: Add tests in harden phase`
- **Phase Markers**: Include phase when relevant
- - `// TODO: [harden] Add integration tests`
- - `// TODO: [ship] Add proper error messages`
- **No Naked TODOs**: Always include what needs to be done
- **Review TODOs**: Check all TODOs before shipping

### Code Quality Gates
- No ESLint errors
- No TypeScript errors
- Test coverage >80% for shipped code
- Documentation for public APIs

### Performance Standards
- CLI commands respond within 500ms
- Build completes within 30s
- Tests complete within 30s

## Next Steps

1. Review exploration approaches
2. Make decision with `hodge decide`
3. Start building with `hodge build general`
