# HODGE.md

This file provides AI assistants with context about the current Hodge workflow state.

## Current Status
**Feature**: general
**Mode**: explore
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30T03:54:33.922Z
## Current Session
**Resumed**: 18 minutes ago
**Progress**: Explored HODGE-300 - template ready for AI approach generation
**Working on**: HODGE-300 (explore mode)
## AI Context Restoration
You were helping with HODGE-300. Explored HODGE-300 - template ready for AI approach generation
Suggested next: Review exploration and decide with 'hodge decide'
## Recent Decisions

- **2025-09-29**: Interactive prompt with session memory for skip mechanism - respects user choice while encouraging best practices
- **2025-09-29**: Use {FEATURE}-{slug}
- **2025-09-29**: Keep lessons-draft
- **2025-09-29**: Few questions (3-4) for lessons enhancement - balance insight gathering with low friction
- **2025-09-29**: Interactive AI Enhancement Flow - integrate lessons review into /ship command with AI-guided questions and skip option

## Active Standards

### The Hodge Way
- - Test behavior, not implementation
- - Never test console.log calls or mock interactions
- - Tests evolve with code maturity
- - `any` is allowed in explore mode
- - Types tighten as code matures
- - TypeScript inference over explicit types
- - **Explore**: Rapid prototyping, no rules
- - **Build**: Basic standards, smoke tests
- - **Harden**: Strict standards, integration tests
- - **Ship**: Production ready, full coverage

### Core Standards
- TypeScript with strict mode
- ESLint rules enforced
- Prettier formatting

### CLI Architecture Standards
- Commands are called by Claude Code slash commands, never directly by developers
- There is no possibility of user interaction when called from slash commands
- NO prompts, confirmations, or user input of any kind
- All parameters must come from command arguments or environment variables
- If a decision is needed, the command should make a sensible default choice
- Use exit codes and structured output to communicate state

### Testing Requirements
- Test what users see, not how it works
- Focus on behavior and contracts
- Prefer integration tests over unit tests
- Use real dependencies when possible
- All tests must use temporary directories (`os.tmpdir()`) for file operations
- Use mocks or stubs instead of modifying actual project state
- Any test that needs a `.hodge` structure should create it in an isolated temp directory
- This prevents tests from corrupting project data or affecting other tests
- Violation of this rule can lead to data loss and unpredictable test behavior

### Code Comments and TODOs
- **TODO Convention**: Always use `// TODO:` comments for incomplete work
- - Format: `// TODO: [phase] description`
- - Examples:
- - `// TODO: Add error handling before ship`
- - `// TODO: Implement caching for performance`
- - `// TODO: Add tests in harden phase`
- **Phase Markers**: Include phase when relevant
- - `// TODO: [harden] Add integration tests`
- - `// TODO: [ship] Add proper error messages`
- **No Naked TODOs**: Always include what needs to be done
- **Review TODOs**: Check all TODOs before shipping

### Code Quality Gates
- No ESLint errors
- No TypeScript errors
- Test coverage >80% for shipped code
- Documentation for public APIs

### Performance Standards
- CLI commands respond within 500ms
- Build completes within 30s
- Tests complete within 30s

### Progressive Enforcement
- Standards are **suggestions only**
- Use `any` types freely
- Skip tests entirely
- Focus on proving concepts
- Standards **should** be followed
- Basic type safety
- Smoke tests required
- Error handling sketched
- Standards **must** be followed (warnings)
- Strict types required
- Integration tests required
- Comprehensive error handling
- Standards **strictly enforced** (blocking)
- All quality gates must pass
- Full test coverage required
- Performance benchmarks met

## Next Steps

1. Review exploration approaches
2. Make decision with `hodge decide`
3. Start building with `hodge build general`
