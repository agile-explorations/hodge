# HODGE.md

This file provides AI assistants with context about the current Hodge workflow state.

## Current Status
**Feature**: general
**Mode**: explore
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-18T14:49:12.386Z
## Current Session
**Resumed**: 47 minutes ago
**Working on**: auth-system (explore mode)
## AI Context Restoration
You were helping with auth-system. Continue from where we left off.
Suggested next: Complete exploration and make decisions
## Core Principles

- **1. AI-Backend Separation**: - **AI (Claude) Role**: Intellectual work - analysis, extraction, design, proposals

## Recent Decisions

- **2025-09-18**: The only hodge CLI command typically used by developers will be init
- **2025-09-18**: There will no longer be any effort given toward making hodge a tool intended for developers to use from the command line
- **2025-09-18**: All AI interactions and workflows for Claude Code slash commands will be in the
- **2025-09-18**: We are abandoning all effort to enable Hodge to integrate with any AI-assisted software development tool other than Claude Code
- **2025-09-17**: Implement AI-Executable Slash Commands using Command Orchestration Protocol

## Active Standards

### Core Standards
- TypeScript with strict mode
- ESLint rules enforced
- Prettier formatting

### Code Comments and TODOs
- **TODO Convention**: Always use `// TODO:` comments for incomplete work
- - Format: `// TODO: [phase] description`
- - Examples:
- - `// TODO: Add error handling before ship`
- - `// TODO: Implement caching for performance`
- - `// TODO: Add tests in harden phase`
- **Phase Markers**: Include phase when relevant
- - `// TODO: [harden] Add integration tests`
- - `// TODO: [ship] Add proper error messages`
- **No Naked TODOs**: Always include what needs to be done
- **Review TODOs**: Check all TODOs before shipping

### Code Quality Gates
- No ESLint errors
- No TypeScript errors
- Test coverage >80% for shipped code
- Documentation for public APIs

### Performance Standards
- CLI commands respond within 500ms
- Build completes within 30s
- Tests complete within 30s

## Next Steps

1. Review exploration approaches
2. Make decision with `hodge decide`
3. Start building with `hodge build general`
