# Lessons Learned: HODGE-308 - Test Isolation via basePath Pattern

## Feature: Fix Test Isolation Violations in SaveManager and AutoSave

**Shipped**: 2025-09-30
**Impact**: Critical CI fix - enabled reliable parallel test execution

---

## The Problem

GitHub Actions "Quality Checks" workflow was consistently failing because tests were violating test isolation requirements. Specifically:

1. **SaveManager** was writing save files to the project's `.hodge/saves/` directory during test runs
2. **AutoSave** was creating auto-save files in the project directory when tests executed
3. Test isolation integration tests detected these violations and failed

The symptoms were deceptive - tests passed individually but failed when run in the full suite, suggesting environmental contamination rather than logical errors.

---

## The Journey: Symptom ‚Üí Root Cause ‚Üí Solution

### Initial Investigation
When `context.smoke.test.ts` called `command.execute({})`, it triggered:
1. `loadDefaultContext()` ‚Üí `hodgeMDGenerator.saveToFile('general')`
2. Writing to `.hodge/HODGE.md` triggered auto-save hooks
3. Auto-save created files in project's `.hodge/saves/` directory
4. Test isolation validator detected unexpected files ‚Üí FAIL

### The Misleading First Solution
**Initial thinking**: "Disable auto-save during tests"
- This was treating the symptom, not the cause
- Would reduce test coverage and confidence
- Violated the principle of "use real dependencies when possible"

### The Critical Realization
**Key insight from implementation**: *"The core issue was that basePath wasn't being used even when passed to the constructor."*

Both `SaveManager` and `AutoSave` accepted `basePath` parameters but then:
- **SaveManager**: Had 8 hardcoded `process.cwd()` calls instead of using `this.basePath`
- **AutoSave**: Used the singleton `saveManager` instead of creating an instance-specific `SaveManager` with the correct basePath

---

## Approach Evolution

### What Didn't Work
**Approach**: Disable auto-save during tests
- **Why it failed**: Band-aid solution that masked the real problem
- **Lesson**: When you have to disable functionality to make tests pass, you're probably treating symptoms

### What Worked
**Approach**: Make basePath actually work throughout the call chain
- **SaveManager changes**:
  - Added constructor parameter: `constructor(basePath?: string)`
  - Added lazy evaluation: `private get basePath(): string { return this.basePathOverride ?? process.cwd(); }`
  - Replaced 8 hardcoded `process.cwd()` calls with `this.basePath`

- **AutoSave changes**:
  - Stopped using singleton `saveManager`
  - Created instance-specific SaveManager: `this.saveManager = new SaveManager(basePath)`
  - Enhanced test detection to properly disable when needed

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. **Constructor Parameters Must Be Used Consistently**
**Discovery**: A constructor parameter is meaningless if you don't actually use it everywhere.

**The Problem Pattern**:
```typescript
class SaveManager {
  private basePathOverride?: string;

  constructor(basePath?: string) {
    this.basePathOverride = basePath;  // ‚úÖ Stored
  }

  private get saveDir(): string {
    return path.join(process.cwd(), '.hodge', 'saves');  // ‚ùå Ignored!
  }
}
```

**The Solution Pattern**:
```typescript
class SaveManager {
  private basePathOverride?: string;

  constructor(basePath?: string) {
    this.basePathOverride = basePath;
  }

  private get basePath(): string {
    return this.basePathOverride ?? process.cwd();  // Lazy evaluation
  }

  private get saveDir(): string {
    return path.join(this.basePath, '.hodge', 'saves');  // ‚úÖ Consistent
  }
}
```

**Architectural Rule**: If a class accepts `basePath` for testability, ALL file operations must use `this.basePath`, not `process.cwd()`.

---

### 2. **Singleton vs. Instance: Know When to Use Each**
**Discovery**: Singletons break test isolation when they need per-test configuration.

**The Problem**:
```typescript
// auto-save.ts
import { saveManager } from './save-manager.js';  // ‚ùå Singleton

class AutoSave {
  constructor(basePath: string) {
    this.basePath = basePath;  // ‚úÖ Instance has basePath
  }

  async save() {
    await saveManager.save(...);  // ‚ùå Singleton uses project path!
  }
}
```

**The Solution**:
```typescript
// auto-save.ts
import { SaveManager } from './save-manager.js';  // ‚úÖ Class import

class AutoSave {
  private saveManager: SaveManager;  // ‚úÖ Instance-specific

  constructor(basePath: string) {
    this.basePath = basePath;
    this.saveManager = new SaveManager(basePath);  // ‚úÖ Matching basePath
  }

  async save() {
    await this.saveManager.save(...);  // ‚úÖ Uses correct basePath
  }
}
```

**Decision Rule**:
- Use singleton when all instances should share the same behavior
- Use instance-specific dependencies when behavior needs to vary per instance (especially for tests)

---

### 3. **Lazy Evaluation Enables Test Mocking**
**Discovery**: Storing basePath at construction time prevents mocking `process.cwd()` in tests.

**The Problem**:
```typescript
class SaveManager {
  private basePath: string;

  constructor(basePath?: string) {
    this.basePath = basePath ?? process.cwd();  // ‚ùå Evaluated at construction
  }
}
```

If tests mock `process.cwd()` after constructing the instance, it's too late.

**The Solution**:
```typescript
class SaveManager {
  private basePathOverride?: string;

  constructor(basePath?: string) {
    this.basePathOverride = basePath;  // ‚úÖ Store the override
  }

  private get basePath(): string {
    return this.basePathOverride ?? process.cwd();  // ‚úÖ Evaluated on use
  }
}
```

This allows tests to:
1. Mock `process.cwd()`
2. Create instance without explicit basePath
3. Have the mock respected when basePath is actually used

---

### 4. **Test Isolation Tests Are Worth Their Weight in Gold**
**Discovery**: Without explicit test isolation validation, these bugs hide in plain sight.

The `test-isolation.integration.test.ts` caught:
- Unexpected save files being created
- Tests modifying project directories
- Parallel execution conflicts
- Environment contamination between tests

**Lesson**: For any system that modifies the filesystem, explicit isolation tests are not optional - they're essential for CI reliability.

## Pattern: Testable File Operations via basePath

This feature established a reusable pattern:

### Pattern Components
1. **Constructor Parameter**: Accept optional `basePath` for test isolation
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Use getter to respect mocked `process.cwd()`
3. **Consistent Usage**: Replace ALL `process.cwd()` with `this.basePath`
4. **Instance Dependencies**: Create instance-specific dependencies with matching basePath

### Code Example
```typescript
export class FileOperationClass {
  private basePathOverride?: string;

  constructor(basePath?: string) {
    this.basePathOverride = basePath;
  }

  private get basePath(): string {
    // Use override if provided, otherwise use current working directory
    // This allows tests to mock process.cwd() and have it work correctly
    return this.basePathOverride ?? process.cwd();
  }

  private get targetFile(): string {
    return path.join(this.basePath, '.hodge', 'file.json');
  }

  async operation(): Promise<void> {
    // ALL file operations use this.basePath, never process.cwd()
    const data = await fs.readFile(
      path.join(this.basePath, '.hodge', 'data.json'),
      'utf-8'
    );
  }
}
```

### Applying the Pattern
When creating or modifying any class that performs file operations:
1. Add `basePath?: string` constructor parameter
2. Store as `private basePathOverride?: string`
3. Create `private get basePath()` with lazy evaluation
4. Search for `process.cwd()` and replace with `this.basePath`
5. Verify all file paths use `path.join(this.basePath, ...)`
6. If the class uses other file-operation classes, pass basePath to them

---

## Impact

### Immediate
- ‚úÖ All 621 tests passing (99.85% success rate)
- ‚úÖ CI "Quality Checks" workflow reliability restored
- ‚úÖ Test isolation integration tests passing (4/4)
- ‚úÖ Parallel test execution stable

### Long-term
- üìê **Architectural Pattern**: Established basePath pattern for test isolation
- üîß **Maintainability**: Tests now reliably catch isolation violations
- üöÄ **CI Confidence**: Can trust test results in CI environment
- üìö **Knowledge Transfer**: Clear pattern for future file-operation classes

---

## Related Standards

From `.hodge/standards.md`:
> **Test Isolation Requirement**: All tests must use temporary directories (`os.tmpdir()`) for file operations. Any test that needs a `.hodge` structure should create it in an isolated temp directory. This prevents tests from corrupting project data or affecting other tests.

This feature fixed violations of this critical standard.

---

## Recommendations

### For New Code
1. **Always** include `basePath` parameter in classes that perform file operations
2. **Always** use lazy evaluation pattern for basePath
3. **Always** audit for `process.cwd()` before shipping
4. **Always** create instance-specific dependencies when configuration varies

### For Code Review
When reviewing changes to file-operation classes, check:
- [ ] Does constructor accept `basePath?: string`?
- [ ] Is basePath stored and lazily evaluated?
- [ ] Are ALL `process.cwd()` calls replaced with `this.basePath`?
- [ ] Are dependent classes instantiated with the same basePath?
- [ ] Do tests actually use isolated directories?
