### Release Notes

#### Hodge Core Standards Implementation

Implemented a simple, template-based system for installing Hodge core standards during project initialization. This provides "The Hodge Way" - opinionated defaults that help teams get started quickly while maintaining flexibility.

**Key Features:**
- Template-based standards installation during `hodge init`
- Pre-configured standards including Progressive Testing and Progressive Type Safety
- Pattern library with starter patterns
- Principles document outlining the Hodge philosophy
- Decision tracking templates with example decisions

**Approach:**
- Mirrors the Claude commands installation pattern - simple file copying
- Preserves user customizations (won't overwrite existing files)
- Removed complex configuration cascade in favor of simplicity
- Templates can be customized after installation

### Implementation Details

The feature introduces:
1. **Template Files** in `src/templates/hodge-way/`:
   - `standards.md` - Development standards with phase-based requirements
   - `patterns/README.md` - Pattern library with examples
   - `principles.md` - Five core Hodge principles
   - `decisions.md` - Decision tracking template

2. **Installation Function** (`installHodgeWay`):
   - Copies templates to `.hodge/` directory
   - Checks for existing files to avoid overwrites
   - Provides granular control over which files to install

3. **Integration**: Updated structure-generator to use template installation instead of dynamic generation

feat(init): Implement Hodge core standards with template-based approach

Implemented a simple, template-based system for installing Hodge core standards
during project initialization. This provides "The Hodge Way" - opinionated
defaults for standards, patterns, principles, and decisions.

Key changes:
- Add template files representing Hodge core standards and philosophy
- Create installHodgeWay() function to copy templates during init
- Update structure-generator to use template installation
- Remove complex configuration cascade approach in favor of simplicity
- Update tests to verify template copying behavior

Closes hodge-core-standards
