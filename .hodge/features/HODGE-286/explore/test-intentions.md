# Test Intentions for HODGE-286

## Purpose
Document what we intend to test when this feature moves to build mode.
These are not actual tests, but a checklist of behaviors to verify.

## Core Requirements
- [ ] Should not crash when executed
- [ ] Should complete within reasonable time (<500ms)
- [ ] Should handle invalid input gracefully
- [ ] Should integrate with existing systems

## General-Specific Requirements
- [ ] Should provide the intended functionality
- [ ] Should integrate with existing code
- [ ] Should handle errors appropriately
- [ ] Should be maintainable and documented

## Approach-Specific Tests
- [ ] Selected implementation approach should work correctly
- [ ] Solution integrates well with existing codebase

## Integration Tests
- [ ] Should work with current authentication system
- [ ] Should respect user permissions
- [ ] Should handle database transactions properly
- [ ] Should emit appropriate events/logs

## Performance Criteria
- [ ] Response time < 200ms for typical operations
- [ ] Memory usage should not increase significantly
- [ ] Should handle concurrent operations
- [ ] Should scale to expected load

## User Experience
- [ ] Should provide clear error messages
- [ ] Should have appropriate loading states
- [ ] Should be intuitive to use
- [ ] Should work across supported browsers/platforms

## Lessons-Specific Test Intentions

### Automatic Draft Generation
- [ ] Should create lessons draft file during ship command
- [ ] Should capture git diff summary in draft
- [ ] Should include test metrics (count, coverage, duration)
- [ ] Should record patterns learned during ship
- [ ] Should handle ship failures gracefully (no partial lessons)

### File Management
- [ ] Should create lessons in correct directory (.hodge/lessons/)
- [ ] Should use consistent naming (HODGE-XXX-YYYYMMDD.md)
- [ ] Should not overwrite existing lessons files
- [ ] Should handle file system errors gracefully

### Content Quality
- [ ] Should follow structured template format
- [ ] Should include all required sections (What Changed, Challenges, Insights, Metrics)
- [ ] Should escape/sanitize any user input properly
- [ ] Should handle features with no significant changes

### Integration with Ship Workflow
- [ ] Should not block ship if lessons generation fails
- [ ] Should log lessons creation in ship output
- [ ] Should preserve lessons even if commit fails
- [ ] Should work with both auto and manual ship modes

### AI Enhancement Flow
- [ ] Draft should be readable by AI for enhancement
- [ ] Should preserve objective data when AI enhances
- [ ] Should handle case where draft exists but hasn't been enhanced
- [ ] Should support re-generation if needed

## Notes
Add any specific test scenarios or edge cases discovered during exploration:

- Test with features that have no code changes (documentation only)
- Test with very large features (100+ file changes)
- Test recovery when lessons directory doesn't exist
- Test when running ship multiple times for same feature
