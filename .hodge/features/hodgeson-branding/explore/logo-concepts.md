# Hodgeson Logo Concepts

## Design Philosophy
The logo should embody "Freedom to explore, discipline to build, confidence to ship" while being modern, memorable, and versatile.

## Logo Concept 1: The Compass Rose
**Visual**: A stylized compass with three distinct points
- **Design**: Modern, geometric compass rose
- **Colors**:
  - Explore (North): Cyan/Teal (#06B6D4)
  - Build (East): Blue (#3B82F6)
  - Ship (South): Green (#10B981)
  - Center: Deep purple or black
- **Symbolism**:
  - Compass = exploration and navigation
  - Three colored points = three modes
  - Circular form = continuous cycle
- **Typography**: "HODGESON" in clean, modern sans-serif below
- **Variations**:
  - Full color version
  - Monochrome for terminals
  - Icon-only for small spaces

## Logo Concept 2: The Triple Arrow
**Visual**: Three arrows forming a cycle or forward momentum
- **Design**: Three interconnected arrows (→ ↗ ↑)
- **Layout**:
  ```
     ↗ (ship)
   ↑     →
  (build) (explore)
  ```
- **Colors**: Gradient from cyan → blue → green
- **Symbolism**:
  - Forward movement and progress
  - Continuous improvement cycle
  - Each arrow = different phase
- **Typography**: "Hodgeson" with the 'o' replaced by the arrow symbol
- **Usage**: Works well as favicon and CLI banner

## Logo Concept 3: The Building Blocks
**Visual**: Three interlocking hexagons
- **Design**: Three hexagons arranged in a cluster
- **Structure**:
  ```
    ⬡ ⬡
     ⬡
  ```
- **Colors**: Each hexagon in different shade
  - Light: Explore (#E0F2FE)
  - Medium: Build (#60A5FA)
  - Dark: Ship (#1E40AF)
- **Symbolism**:
  - Building blocks = modular development
  - Hexagons = strength and efficiency
  - Interlocking = integration of modes
- **Typography**: Modern, geometric font matching hexagon angles

## Logo Concept 4: The Wave Pattern
**Visual**: Three flowing waves forming an 'H'
- **Design**: Abstract waves that create negative space 'H'
- **Flow**: Left to right suggesting progress
- **Colors**: Ocean-inspired palette
  - Wave 1: Light turquoise (explore)
  - Wave 2: Deep blue (build)
  - Wave 3: Teal-green (ship)
- **Symbolism**:
  - Fluidity between modes
  - Natural flow of development
  - Hidden 'H' for Hodgeson
- **Animation potential**: Waves could animate in CLI loading screens

**Visual**: Connected dots forming a distinctive pattern
- **Design**: 7-9 dots connected by lines
- **Pattern**: Abstract 'H' or ship steering wheel
- **Elements**:
  - Large dots: Major modes (explore/build/ship)
  - Small dots: Transitions/decisions
  - Lines: Workflow connections
- **Colors**:
  - Dots: White on dark or black on light
  - Lines: Gradient showing flow
