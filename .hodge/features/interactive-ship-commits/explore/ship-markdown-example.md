# Example: Enhanced ship.md for Claude Code

This is what the actual `.claude/commands/ship.md` file would look like:

```markdown
# Ship Feature to Production

Completes the development cycle by shipping a feature with quality checks and git integration.

## Usage
/ship <feature>

---

First, let me prepare the ship process for {{feature}}:

```bash
hodge ship {{feature}}
```

Now let me load the prepared commit details:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;
const stateFile = '.hodge/temp/ship-interaction/state.json';
const messageFile = '.hodge/temp/ship-interaction/commit-message.txt';

try {
  const state = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(stateFile, 'utf-8'));
  const message = await fs.readFile(messageFile, 'utf-8');

  console.log('State loaded successfully');
  console.log(`Files changed: ${state.analysis.files.length}`);
  console.log(`Commit type: ${state.analysis.type}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Preparing fresh analysis...');
}
```

üí° **Pro Tips**:
- Use `/ship {{feature}} --dry-run` to preview without committing
- Add `--no-interactive` to skip this review
- Configure defaults in `.hodge/config.json`
```

## This Markdown Template Provides:

1. **Rich Visual Experience**
   - Tables for file changes
   - Collapsible sections for additional info
   - Syntax highlighting for code
   - Emoji indicators for clarity

2. **Educational Content**
   - Explains WHY certain formats are used
   - Links to documentation
   - Shows examples

3. **Flexible Interaction**
   - Multiple paths based on user preference
   - Can iterate multiple times
   - Preserves context between interactions

4. **Smart Validation**
   - Checks message format
   - Suggests improvements
   - Warns about potential issues

5. **Integration Points**
