# Build Plan: HODGE-287

## Feature Overview
**PM Issue**: HODGE-287 (linear)
**Status**: In Progress

## Implementation Checklist

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Create main component/module
- [ ] Implement core logic
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Include inline documentation

### Integration
- [ ] Connect with existing modules
- [ ] Update CLI/API endpoints
- [ ] Configure dependencies

### Quality Checks
- [ ] Follow coding standards
- [ ] Use established patterns
- [ ] Add basic validation
- [ ] Consider edge cases

## Files Modified
<!-- Track files as you modify them -->
- `.hodge/features/HODGE-287/explore/exploration.md` - Documented 3 approaches for context compaction resilience
- `.hodge/features/HODGE-287/explore/test-intentions.md` - Updated with state persistence test scenarios
- `.hodge/features/HODGE-287/explore/command-state-prototype.ts` - Created prototype for future implementation
- `.hodge/decisions.md` - Recorded 4 architectural decisions

## Decisions Made
<!-- Document any implementation decisions -->
- Use JSON with versioning for state storage
- 30-minute timeout with age check on load
- Prompt user before resuming saved state
- Start with critical commands: /explore, /build, /harden, /ship
- **DEFERRED**: Implementation postponed until final refinement phase

## Testing Notes
<!-- Notes for testing approach -->
- Test scenario 1
- Test scenario 2

## Next Steps
After implementation:
1. Run tests with `npm test`
2. Check linting with `npm run lint`
3. Review changes
4. Proceed to `/harden HODGE-287` for production readiness
