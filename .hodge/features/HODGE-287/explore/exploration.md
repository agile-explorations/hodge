# Exploration: HODGE-287

## Feature Overview
**PM Issue**: HODGE-287
**Type**: general
**Created**: 2025-09-22T15:44:00.519Z

## Context
- **Standards**: Loaded (suggested only)
- **Available Patterns**: 9
- **Similar Features**: hodge-branding, HODGE-001, HODGE-002
- **Relevant Patterns**: None identified

## Problem Analysis
When Claude Code's conversation context gets compacted during multi-step slash commands:
- Command template instructions are lost
- User choices and interactions disappear
- Current step tracking is lost
- Feature context and state vanish
- The command cannot complete properly

Currently, users must manually restart the command after compaction, losing progress and context.

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Command State Persistence
Create a state persistence layer that saves command progress to disk:
- Write command state to `.hodge/temp/command-state.json` after each step
- Include: command name, feature, current step, user choices, timestamp
- Commands check for and resume from saved state on restart
- Clear state file when command completes successfully

**Pros:**
- Survives compaction completely
- Simple to implement
- Works with existing slash command structure
- No changes to markdown files needed

**Cons:**
- Requires modifying all slash commands
- State file could get out of sync
- Extra I/O operations

### Approach 2: Context Preservation Markers
Embed special markers in conversation that survive compaction:
- Add HTML comments with checkpoint data: `<!-- CHECKPOINT: explore-step-3 -->`
- Include critical context in these markers
- Commands scan for markers to determine resume point
- Use structured data format in markers

**Pros:**
- Lives in conversation itself
- No external state files
- Visible in conversation history

**Cons:**
- Relies on compaction algorithm preserving comments
- Clutters conversation with metadata
- May not survive aggressive compaction

### Approach 3: Hybrid Recovery System
Combine state persistence with recovery instructions:
- Save minimal state to `.hodge/temp/command-state/[command]-[feature].json`
- Add "Compaction Recovery" section to each command markdown
- Include state check at command start
- Provide manual recovery instructions as fallback
- Use interaction state manager pattern from ship command

**Pros:**
- Multiple recovery paths
- Graceful degradation
- Leverages existing patterns
- Most resilient to failures

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Requires changes to both CLI and markdown

## Recommendation
**Recommended Approach: Hybrid Recovery System**

This approach provides the best resilience by combining automatic recovery with manual fallback. It follows the existing interaction state pattern already proven in the ship command, making it consistent with current architecture.

## Decisions Needed
1. **State Storage Format**: JSON with versioning or simple key-value?
2. **State Lifetime**: Clear after 30 minutes or on next command?
3. **Recovery UI**: Automatic resume or prompt user first?
4. **Scope**: All workflow commands or start with critical ones?

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review exploration findings
- [ ] Use `/decide` to make implementation decisions
- [ ] Proceed to `/build HODGE-287`
