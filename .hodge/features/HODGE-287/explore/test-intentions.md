# Test Intentions for HODGE-287

## Purpose
Document what we intend to test when this feature moves to build mode.
These are not actual tests, but a checklist of behaviors to verify.

## Core Requirements
- [ ] Should not crash when executed
- [ ] Should complete within reasonable time (<500ms)
- [ ] Should handle invalid input gracefully
- [ ] Should integrate with existing systems

## General-Specific Requirements
- [ ] Command state should persist to disk correctly
- [ ] State should include all necessary recovery information
- [ ] Recovery should work seamlessly after compaction
- [ ] Old state files should be cleaned up appropriately

## Approach-Specific Tests
- [ ] State persistence should save after each command step
- [ ] Commands should detect and load existing state on startup
- [ ] Recovery instructions should be clear and actionable
- [ ] State format should be versioned for compatibility

## Integration Tests
- [ ] Should work with all workflow commands (/explore, /build, /harden, /ship)
- [ ] Should integrate with existing InteractionStateManager
- [ ] Should not interfere with normal command execution
- [ ] Should handle concurrent command executions

## Performance Criteria
- [ ] Response time < 200ms for typical operations
- [ ] Memory usage should not increase significantly
- [ ] Should handle concurrent operations
- [ ] Should scale to expected load

## User Experience
- [ ] Should provide clear error messages
- [ ] Should have appropriate loading states
- [ ] Should be intuitive to use
- [ ] Should work across supported browsers/platforms

## Notes
Add any specific test scenarios or edge cases discovered during exploration:

- Test compaction during each step of /explore command
- Test compaction between user choice and command continuation
- Test recovery with stale state files (>30 minutes old)
- Test multiple compactions in same command session
- Test state conflicts when switching between features mid-command
