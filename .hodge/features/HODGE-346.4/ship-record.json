  "commitMessage": "feat(ux): add smart context awareness to slash commands (HODGE-346.4)\n\nImplement Phase 2 (Template Intelligence) of HODGE-346 UX system, adding\nintelligent behavior to all 10 slash command templates through context-aware\nfiltering, progress indicators, and celebration messaging. Commands now adapt\nbased on project state and user workflow patterns.\n\n## What Changed\n\n### Slash Command Templates (All 10 Updated)\n- **Smart \"What's Next?\" Filtering**: All commands now use `hodge status {{feature}}`\n  to conditionally show relevant next steps based on workflow state\n  - /explore, /decide, /build, /harden, /ship: Workflow-aware suggestions\n  - /hodge: Context-specific recommendations (5 conditional scenarios)\n  - /status, /plan, /review, /codify: Smart follow-up actions\n\n- **Progress Indicators**: Added visual \"you are here\" markers\n  - /harden: 7-step progress boxes (üìç Step X of 7)\n  - /ship: 4-step progress tracking\n  - Shows completed steps (‚úì) and remaining steps (‚óã)\n\n- **Celebration Display**: /ship now includes achievement-based celebrations\n  - 4 celebration tiers based on velocity (ships/week, consecutive weeks)\n  - Momentum tracking: ships this week/month, streaks\n  - Achievement unlocks: \"Unstoppable\" (5+/week), \"Shipping Machine\" (3-4/week)\n\n- **Contextual Tips**: /build and /harden now integrate lesson matching\n  - Three-tier tip system: proactive (high confidence + critical), reactive\n    (medium confidence), inline (low confidence)\n  - Lesson pattern matching with `hodge lessons --match`\n  - Real-time guidance based on past feature learnings\n\n### Test Organization (4 Files Reorganized)\n- Moved 3 smoke test files from `.claude/commands/` to `src/commands/`\n  - choice-formatting.smoke.test.ts (preserved 98% git history)\n  - visual-patterns.smoke.test.ts (preserved 96% git history)\n  - visual-rendering.smoke.test.ts (preserved 91% git history)\n- Fixed hodge-324.smoke.test.ts: removed unused import, fixed formatting\n- Updated all test files to match new template patterns:\n  - \"Next Steps\" ‚Üí \"What's Next?\" (section rename)\n  - \"Post-Ship Actions\" ‚Üí \"What's Next?\" (consistency)\n  - Added skip logic for template variable boxes ({{lesson.excerpt}})\n\n### Quality & Metadata\n- Updated harden reports: quality checks, critical files, review manifest\n- Regenerated duplication report (1.9% - excellent)\n- Updated project management tracking\n\n## Why This Change\n\n**Problem**: Slash commands lacked intelligent adaptation - same output for every\nuser regardless of project state, workflow position, or achievement history.\nScanning irrelevant suggestions created cognitive overhead and missed learning\nopportunities. Multi-step workflows (like /harden's 7 steps) felt disorienting\nwithout progress indicators.\n\n**Solution**: Implemented three intelligence patterns:\n1. **Context Awareness**: Commands check `hodge status` and filter suggestions\n   based on actual workflow state (e.g., don't suggest /decide if no decisions)\n2. **Progress Framing**: Visual indicators show \"you are here\" in multi-step flows\n3. **Celebration & Learning**: Surface achievements and relevant lessons at\n   decision points\n\n**Architecture**: Template-driven (AI layer), CLI provides data (structure + state),\nmaintaining clean separation of concerns established in HODGE-346.2.\n\n## Impact\n\n### For Users\n- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Only see relevant next steps, not all possibilities\n- **Better Orientation**: Know exactly where you are in multi-step workflows\n- **Motivation & Recognition**: Celebrate shipping velocity and consecutive weeks\n- **Learning Transfer**: See relevant lessons from past features at key decision points\n- **Consistent Experience**: Unified visual language across all 10 commands\n\n### For Codebase\n- **All 1237 tests passing** (up from 1225 - added 12 new tests)\n- **Zero regressions**: Fixed template changes that broke 7 tests\n- **1.9% code duplication** (maintained excellent quality)\n- **Zero TypeScript errors** (strict mode)\n- **Test organization improved**: Smoke tests properly located in src/commands/\n\n### Quality Gates\n- ‚úÖ Tests: 1237/1237 passing\n- ‚úÖ TypeScript: 0 errors (strict mode)\n- ‚úÖ ESLint: 0 errors (474 acceptable warnings)\n- ‚úÖ Build: Succeeded\n- ‚úÖ Duplication: 1.9%\n- ‚úÖ Harden validation: All checks passed\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
