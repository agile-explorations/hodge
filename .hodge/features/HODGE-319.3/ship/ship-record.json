  "commitMessage": "feat: add smart decision extraction to /build command (HODGE-319.3)\n\n## What Changed\n- **Template Enhancement** (.claude/commands/build.md - 138 lines added)\n  - Added Decision Extraction section before PM check (4-step process)\n  - Step 1: Check for decisions.md in correct location\n  - Step 2: Detect and offer to move wrong-location decisions.md files\n  - Step 3: Extract Recommendation + Decisions Needed from exploration.md\n  - Step 4: Present 4 fallback cases with user prompts (A: single recommendation, B: multiple recommendations, C: no recommendation, D: missing exploration)\n\n- **Auto-sync** (src/lib/claude-commands.ts - 138 lines added)\n  - Synchronized template changes to TypeScript via sync script\n  - No manual code changes, purely automated from template\n\n- **Test Coverage** (src/lib/hodge-319.3.smoke.test.ts - new file)\n  - Added 14 smoke tests validating template structure\n  - Tests verify decision extraction logic, user prompts, edge cases\n  - All tests passing in 7ms\n\n- **Metadata Updates** (6 files)\n  - .hodge/HODGE.md: Updated feature status to \"hardening\"\n  - .hodge/context.json: Feature context refresh\n  - .hodge/id-mappings.json: PM tracking updated\n  - .hodge/.session: Session state preserved\n  - .hodge/project_management.md: Linear integration sync\n\n## Why This Change\nUsers previously had to run /decide before /build, even when the exploration.md already contained a clear Recommendation. This created unnecessary friction in the workflow. The /build command now intelligently extracts guidance from exploration.md when /decide is skipped, presenting users with options to use the recommendation, formalize via /decide, or skip entirely.\n\nThis implements the cascading extraction pattern already proven in /plan (HODGE-315), providing graceful workflow shortcuts while maintaining user agency through explicit approval prompts.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n- **Template-only enhancement** - Zero CLI code changes\n- **Integration point** - Placed before PM check per user guidance (decisions may exist in PM issue)\n- **5 key decisions implemented**:\n  1. Verbatim extraction display (complete context)\n  2. Prompt to pick one (multiple recommendations)\n  3. Auto-move with approval (wrong-location files)\n  4. Skip uncovered decisions detection (defer to /decide)\n  5. Before PM check placement (logical flow)\n\n## Impact\n- âœ… **UX Improvement**: Users can skip /decide and still get intelligent guidance\n- âœ… **Zero Risk**: Template-only change, no CLI modifications\n- âœ… **Well-tested**: 14 smoke tests + 703 total tests passing\n- âœ… **Graceful Degradation**: 4 fallback cases handle all scenarios\n- âœ… **Backward Compatible**: Existing /build flows unchanged\n- âœ… **User Agency**: Explicit prompts at every decision point\n\nCloses HODGE-319.3\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
