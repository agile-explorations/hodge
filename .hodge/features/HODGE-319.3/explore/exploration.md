# Exploration: HODGE-319.3

**Title**: Smart Decision Extraction for /build - Graceful Skip-Decide Workflow

## Problem Statement

When users skip `/decide` and go straight to `/build`, the command only warns about missing decisions instead of extracting available guidance from `exploration.md`. This creates friction and forces manual steps that could be automated. Currently, users see:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  No decision recorded for this feature.
   Review exploration and make a decision first.
   Or use --skip-checks to proceed anyway.
```

This is unhelpful because the `exploration.md` file often contains a **Recommendation** section with the chosen approach and a **Decisions Needed** section with context. The `/plan` command already implements smart cascading extraction (feature decisions ‚Üí exploration ‚Üí global), but `/build` doesn't leverage this pattern.

## Conversation Summary

### Architecture Understanding
The critical insight: `/build` is split between slash command template (`.claude/commands/build.md`) and CLI (`build.ts`). The CLI currently just outputs warnings and proceeds - it doesn't block or prompt. This means **all smart extraction logic belongs in the template**, not the CLI.

### Current Build Flow Analysis
Looking at `build.ts:120-124`, when `decisions.md` is missing:
- CLI warns about no decision
- CLI suggests using `--skip-checks`
- CLI continues anyway (non-blocking)

The `/build` template (`.claude/commands/build.md`) doesn't attempt to extract guidance from `exploration.md` - it just calls the CLI command directly.

### Proven Pattern from /plan
The `/plan` command implements cascading extraction (`plan.ts:124-138`):
1. Check `features/{feature}/decisions.md`
2. Extract from `exploration.md` (Recommendation + Decisions Needed)
3. Fallback to global `decisions.md`

Extraction logic uses regex:
- Recommendation: `## Recommendation\s*\n\n\*\*(.+?)\*\*`
- Decisions Needed: `### Decision \d+: (.+)` headers

HODGE-315 already applies this pattern to improve `/plan` - we should replicate it for `/build`.

### Edge Cases Identified

**1. Multiple Recommendations**
If `exploration.md` contains multiple recommendations (one per approach), prompt user to:
- Approve all of them (if they're complementary)
- Pick one (if they're alternatives)

**2. Malformed Content**
- If Recommendation section is parseable but messy ‚Üí use it anyway
- If completely empty ‚Üí suggest `/decide` process
- If partially malformed ‚Üí extract what's useable

**3. Wrong Location decisions.md**
If user manually created `decisions.md` in wrong location (e.g., `explore/decisions.md`):
- Detect it
- Offer to move to correct location (`features/{feature}/decisions.md`)
- Reformat properly if needed

**4. Uncovered Decisions**
Check if Decisions Needed items are addressed by Recommendation:
- If some decisions are uncovered ‚Üí prompt user to go through `/decide`
- If all covered ‚Üí proceed with confidence

**5. Extraction Scope**
Extract BOTH:
- **Recommendation** (the chosen approach)
- **Decisions Needed** (all individual decisions for context)

This gives AI complete context to understand both the approach AND constraints.

### Implementation Scope

**Template-Only Change** ‚úÖ
- Update `.claude/commands/build.md` only
- Add extraction logic before PM check
- No changes to `build.ts` CLI code

**Why No CLI Changes?**
- CLI already non-blocking (warns and continues)
- All user prompting happens in slash command template
- AI handles extraction, formatting, and interaction
- CLI just reads files and outputs - no decision logic needed

**Integration Point**
Decision extraction happens **before PM check** because:
- Decisions may exist in PM issue description
- We want to leverage that context
- PM creation might reference these decisions

### Test Complexity
Integration tests need to cover:
1. Standard flow: decisions.md exists ‚Üí proceed normally
2. Skip flow: no decisions.md ‚Üí extract from exploration.md
3. Empty Recommendation ‚Üí suggest /decide
4. Multiple recommendations ‚Üí prompt for selection
5. Malformed content ‚Üí graceful degradation
6. Wrong location ‚Üí offer to move
7. Uncovered decisions ‚Üí detect and prompt
8. Complete skip ‚Üí fallback to current warning

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Full AI Extraction in Template (RECOMMENDED)

**Description**: Add smart extraction logic to `.claude/commands/build.md` that reads `exploration.md`, extracts Recommendation + Decisions Needed, and presents options to user - all before calling `hodge build` CLI command.

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Decision Extraction (Before Build)

### Step 1: Check for decisions.md
```bash
cat .hodge/features/{{feature}}/decisions.md 2>/dev/null
```

If found ‚Üí proceed to PM check
If not found ‚Üí continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Extract from exploration.md
```bash
cat .hodge/features/{{feature}}/explore/exploration.md
```

Parse the content for:
- **Recommendation section**: Extract the chosen approach
- **Decisions Needed section**: Extract all decision titles

### Step 3: Present Options to User
If Recommendation found:
```
I found this recommendation from exploration:

   [Recommendation text]

Decisions to consider:
   1. [Decision 1 title]
   2. [Decision 2 title]
   ...

What would you like to do?
  a) ‚úÖ Use this recommendation and proceed with /build
  b) üîÑ Go to /decide to formalize decisions first
  c) ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skip and build without guidance

Your choice:
```

If no Recommendation:
```
No decisions.md found and exploration.md has no recommendation.

Please either:
  a) Run /decide to make decisions
  b) Use --skip-checks to build anyway
```

### Step 4: Handle User Response
- Choice (a) ‚Üí Call `hodge build {{feature}}` with guidance context
- Choice (b) ‚Üí Exit and suggest `hodge decide`
- Choice (c) ‚Üí Call `hodge build {{feature}} --skip-checks`
```

**Pros**:
- Zero CLI changes - template-only enhancement
- Reuses proven extraction pattern from `/plan`
- AI handles all complexity (parsing, prompting, flow control)
- Non-breaking - existing workflows unaffected
- Fast to implement - just template updates

**Cons**:
- Template gets longer (but still manageable)
- Extraction logic duplicated from `/plan` (could extract to shared pattern doc)
- Relies on consistent exploration.md format

**When to use**: When you want quick delivery with zero risk to CLI code

---

### Approach 2: CLI Extraction with Template Prompting

**Description**: Add extraction logic to `build.ts` that reads `exploration.md` and outputs structured data, then template interprets and prompts user.

**Implementation**:
- Modify `build.ts` to add `extractExplorationGuidance()` method
- Output JSON with Recommendation + Decisions Needed
- Template reads JSON and prompts user

**Pros**:
- Single source of truth for extraction logic
- Reusable across commands
- Cleaner template (just prompt, no parsing)
- Better testability (unit tests for CLI extraction)

**Cons**:
- Requires CLI code changes (build.ts modification)
- More implementation effort
- Risk of breaking existing build behavior
- Need to maintain backward compatibility

**When to use**: When planning to extract this to shared library (Phase 3 - WorkflowDataExtractor)

---

### Approach 3: Defer to Phase 3 (WorkflowDataExtractor)

**Description**: Skip this enhancement now, wait for Phase 3 when WorkflowDataExtractor library is built, then apply to `/build`.

**Implementation**:
- Mark HODGE-319.3 as blocked by HODGE-319.4
- Implement WorkflowDataExtractor first (Phase 3)
- Then apply to `/build` using shared library

**Pros**:
- No duplication - use shared library from start
- Consistent pattern across all commands
- Better long-term maintainability

**Cons**:
- Users wait longer for improvement
- Dependencies create blocking (can't parallelize)
- Phase 3 might be delayed or descoped
- Lost opportunity for learning (Phase 2 should inform Phase 3)

**When to use**: When strict adherence to sequential phases is required

## Recommendation

**Use Approach 1: Full AI Extraction in Template**

**Rationale**:
1. **Fast delivery**: Template-only change ships in days, not weeks
2. **Zero risk**: No CLI code modifications = no breaking changes
3. **Learning opportunity**: Implementing this informs Phase 3 WorkflowDataExtractor design
4. **Proven pattern**: `/plan` already does this successfully (plan.ts:164-198)
5. **User value**: Immediate UX improvement for skip-decide workflow
6. **Natural progression**: Phase 2 (UX) before Phase 3 (Standardization) makes sense

**Phase 3 Refactor Path**:
When WorkflowDataExtractor is built (HODGE-319.4), we can:
- Extract shared pattern to library
- Replace template logic with library call
- Keep same user experience, cleaner implementation

**Validation approach**:
- Integration tests verify extraction from exploration.md works
- Edge case tests (malformed, empty, wrong location)
- Manual testing of complete workflow
- No smoke tests needed (template-only, no executable code)

**Success metrics**:
- Users can skip `/decide` and still get intelligent guidance
- No false positives (correct detection of missing decisions)
- Graceful degradation (fallback to warning if extraction fails)
- Complete context preserved (Recommendation + Decisions Needed both extracted)

## Test Intentions

### Core Extraction Behavior
- [ ] When no decisions.md exists, /build should read exploration.md
- [ ] When Recommendation section exists, extract it completely
- [ ] When Decisions Needed section exists, extract all decision titles
- [ ] When both exist, present them together with options
- [ ] When neither exists, fall back to current warning behavior

### User Interaction Flow
- [ ] When Recommendation found, prompt user: use it / go to /decide / skip
- [ ] When user chooses "use it", proceed with hodge build using guidance
- [ ] When user chooses "go to /decide", exit gracefully and suggest command
- [ ] When user chooses "skip", call hodge build --skip-checks
- [ ] All prompts should be clear and actionable

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle multiple recommendations: prompt user to pick one or approve all
- [ ] Handle malformed Recommendation: extract what's useable, warn about formatting
- [ ] Handle empty Recommendation but present Decisions Needed: suggest /decide
- [ ] Detect decisions.md in wrong location (explore/decisions.md): offer to move
- [ ] Check if Decisions Needed are covered by Recommendation: warn if gaps exist

### Integration Points
- [ ] Decision extraction happens before PM check (correct order)
- [ ] PM issue description may contain decisions (don't duplicate)
- [ ] All existing /build flows still work (backward compatible)
- [ ] Template stays under 200 lines (maintainability)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Missing exploration.md ‚Üí fall back to current warning
- [ ] Malformed markdown ‚Üí graceful degradation, use what's parseable
- [ ] File read errors ‚Üí clear error message, suggest manual steps
- [ ] User interrupts prompt ‚Üí exit cleanly without corruption

## Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Extraction Display Format
**Context**: When showing extracted Recommendation to user, how much detail?

**Options**:
- **a) Verbatim** - Show exact text from exploration.md (1-2 paragraphs)
- **b) Summarized** - AI summarizes to 1-2 sentences
- **c) Title only** - Just show approach name (e.g., "Approach 2: Incremental Optimization")

**Recommendation**: Option (a) - verbatim for complete context, user already wrote it

---

### Decision 2: Multiple Recommendations Handling
**Context**: If exploration.md has multiple Recommendation sections (uncommon but possible)

**Options**:
- **a) Prompt for each** - Show all, ask user to approve each individually
- **b) Prompt to pick one** - Present list, user selects which to use
- **c) Use first only** - Assume first is primary, ignore others

**Recommendation**: Option (b) - pick one, matches "choose an approach" mental model

---

### Decision 3: Wrong-Location File Detection
**Context**: How to detect and handle manually created decisions.md in wrong location

**Options**:
- **a) Auto-move with approval** - Detect, prompt "I found decisions.md in explore/, move it? (y/n)"
- **b) Read from wrong location** - Just use it, don't enforce structure
- **c) Warn and exit** - Tell user to move it manually, then re-run

**Recommendation**: Option (a) - auto-move with approval, helps user do the right thing

---

### Decision 4: Uncovered Decisions Detection
**Context**: Check if Recommendation addresses all Decisions Needed items

**Options**:
- **a) Strict matching** - Parse Recommendation for references to each decision number/title
- **b) Keyword matching** - Check if decision topics appear in Recommendation text
- **c) Skip detection** - Assume Recommendation covers everything, don't verify

**Recommendation**: Option (c) - skip detection, too complex for Phase 2, defer to /decide

---

### Decision 5: Template Integration Point
**Context**: Where exactly in build.md should extraction logic go?

**Options**:
- **a) Before PM check** (line 3) - Extract decisions first, then check PM
- **b) After PM check** (line 45) - Check PM first, then extract decisions
- **c) Replace PM check** - Combine into single "pre-build validation" section

**Recommendation**: Option (a) - before PM check per user guidance (decisions may be in PM)

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review exploration findings
- [ ] Use `/decide` to make implementation decisions (5 decisions above)
- [ ] Proceed to `/build HODGE-319.3` with Approach 1 (Template Enhancement)
