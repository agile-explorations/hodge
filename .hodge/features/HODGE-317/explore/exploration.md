# Feature Exploration: HODGE-317

**Title**: Fix flaky test-isolation integration test timeouts

## Problem Statement

Two integration tests in `src/test/test-isolation.integration.test.ts` are failing intermittently with timeout errors:
1. "should maintain complete isolation between test runs" (line 103) - timing out at 10 seconds
2. "should prevent test data from leaking into project" (line 137) - timing out at 5 seconds

These are pre-existing flaky tests unrelated to recent changes (HODGE-316). They are blocking the ship process even though all other 655 tests pass.

## Conversation Summary

The tests are integration tests that verify test isolation by running commands in temporary directories. The timeout issues suggest either:
- The commands are taking longer than expected to complete
- There's a deadlock or hanging process
- The timeout values (5-10s) are too aggressive for integration tests

These tests have been problematic and should be stabilized to prevent blocking future ships.

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Increase Timeout Values

**Description**: Increase the timeout values for these specific integration tests to allow more time for command execution.

**Pros**:
- Quick fix, minimal code changes
- Addresses immediate symptom
- Low risk

**Cons**:
- Doesn't address root cause
- Slower test suite
- May still flake if underlying issue persists

**When to use**: As a temporary measure while investigating root cause.

### Approach 2: Investigate and Fix Root Cause

**Description**: Debug why these tests are timing out - check for hanging processes, slow file operations, or synchronization issues.

**Pros**:
- Fixes actual problem
- Improves test reliability
- Maintains fast test suite

**Cons**:
- Requires investigation time
- May uncover deeper issues
- More complex fix

**When to use**: For a permanent, robust solution.

### Approach 3: Refactor Tests to Use Faster Mocking

**Description**: Convert integration tests to use more mocked dependencies instead of real file system operations.

**Pros**:
- Faster tests
- More reliable
- Easier to control test scenarios

**Cons**:
- Less realistic testing
- May miss real integration issues
- Requires test rewrite

**When to use**: If tests are inherently too slow for integration testing.

## Recommendation

**Approach 2: Investigate and Fix Root Cause** is recommended.

**Rationale**:
- These are important integration tests for test isolation - a critical requirement
- Flaky tests erode confidence in the test suite
- Understanding the root cause will prevent future similar issues
- Once fixed, tests can remain fast and reliable

Investigation steps:
1. Add debug logging to identify where tests hang
2. Check for unclosed file handles or processes
3. Verify temp directory cleanup
4. Profile test execution time

## Test Intentions

### Behavioral Expectations

1. **Should identify root cause of timeout**
   - Given: Flaky test in test-isolation.integration.test.ts
   - When: Debug logging and profiling added
   - Then: Specific bottleneck or deadlock identified

2. **Should fix timeout without increasing limits**
   - Given: Root cause identified
   - When: Fix applied
   - Then: Tests pass consistently within original timeout values

3. **Should verify fix across multiple runs**
   - Given: Fix applied
   - When: Tests run 10+ times
   - Then: No timeout failures occur

## Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Temporary vs Permanent Fix
**Context**: Should we increase timeouts now and investigate later, or block until root cause is fixed?

**Options**:
- a) Increase timeouts temporarily, investigate separately
- b) Block and fix root cause before proceeding
- c) Disable tests temporarily, fix in dedicated sprint

**Recommendation**: Option (a) for HODGE-316 ship, then Option (b) for HODGE-317 implementation.
