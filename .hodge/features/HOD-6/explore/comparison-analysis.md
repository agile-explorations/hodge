# HOD-6 Implementation Comparison

## Quick Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | One-Question | Guided Wizard | Zero-Config |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Time to Init | 10 seconds | 30-60 seconds | <5 seconds |
| User Input | 1 question | 2-6 questions | 0 questions |
| Accuracy | Good | Best | Variable |
| Customization | After init | During init | After init |
| User Control | Medium | High | Low |
| Magic Level | Medium | Low | High |
| Error Prone | Low | Low | Medium |

## Detailed Analysis

### User Experience
- **Zero-Config**: Fastest but least transparent
- **One-Question**: Good balance of speed and control
- **Guided Wizard**: Most educational but slowest

### Developer Experience
- **Zero-Config**: Easiest to implement, hardest to debug
- **One-Question**: Moderate complexity, good maintainability
- **Guided Wizard**: Most complex, best testability

### Flexibility
- **Guided Wizard**: Most flexible during setup
- **One-Question**: Fixed flow with smart defaults
- **Zero-Config**: No flexibility during init

## Philosophy Alignment

Hodge's philosophy: "Freedom to explore, discipline to build, confidence to ship"

- **Zero-Config**: Maximum freedom (just start), but less discipline
- **One-Question**: Balanced - quick freedom with some structure
- **Guided Wizard**: Most discipline upfront, might hinder exploration

## Risk Assessment

### Zero-Config Risks
- Users don't understand what happened
- Wrong detection leads to confusion
- No opportunity to correct mistakes

### One-Question Risks
- Project name might not be enough context
- Users want more control
- Detection still might be wrong

### Guided Wizard Risks
- Too many questions cause abandonment
- Analysis paralysis on options
- Slower onboarding hurts adoption

## Hybrid Recommendation

Implement **One-Question with Escape Hatch**:

```typescript
hodge init              # One question flow (default)
hodge init --quick      # Zero-config mode
hodge init --wizard     # Full guided setup
```

This provides:
1. **Default**: One-question for most users
2. **Power users**: Zero-config for speed
3. **New users**: Wizard for learning

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: One-Question (Approach 1)
   - Fastest to meaningful value
   - Good default experience
   - Can add other modes later

2. **Phase 2**: Add Zero-Config flag
   - Easy addition
   - Uses same detection logic
   - Power user feature

3. **Phase 3**: Add Wizard mode
   - More complex
   - Educational tool
   - Marketing opportunity
