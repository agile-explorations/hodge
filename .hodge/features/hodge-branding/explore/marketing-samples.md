## Sample 2: About Page (With Cat Lore)

```
Why "Hodge"?

Every developer knows the feeling: your project is a hodgepodge 
of frameworks, tools, AI suggestions, and half-remembered decisions. 
Hodge brings harmony to this creative chaos.

The name has a delightful second meaning. Samuel Johnson, the 
great lexicographer, had a cat named Hodge, about whom he declared: 
"He is a very fine cat, a very fine cat indeed." Like Johnson's 
cat, our Hodge is independent yet dependable, curious yet disciplined.

But mainly, we help you turn your hodgepodge into something beautiful.
```

## Sample 3: If Using "Podge" Concept

```
Share Your Wisdom

Export your project's accumulated patterns and decisions as a 
.podge file. Share it with your team, or start new projects 
with your battle-tested standards.

$ hodge share --output teamstandards.podge
$ hodge init myproject --from teamstandards.podge

Your podge is your project's DNA - unique, evolved, and shareable.
```

## Sample 4: Pure Function (No Metaphors)

```
HODGE
AI-assisted development that scales.

Balance exploration with stability. Maintain standards without 
sacrificing speed. Ship with confidence.

Freedom to explore.
Discipline to build.
Confidence to ship.
```

## Sample 5: Developer-Focused README

```markdown
# Hodge

> Freedom to explore, discipline to build, confidence to ship.

Hodge helps you maintain code quality while leveraging AI tools. 
It's not another linter or formatter - it's a development philosophy 
with tooling to match.

## The Problem

AI assistants are powerful but inconsistent. They don't know your 
team's patterns, your codebase's conventions, or your architectural 
decisions. Every session starts from zero.

## The Solution  

Hodge captures your standards, patterns, and decisions as you work.
It builds context that makes AI assistance consistent and aligned 
with your team's practices.

## Why "Hodge"?

Your codebase is a hodgepodge of technologies and patterns. Hodge 
helps you find harmony in the chaos. (And yes, it's also named after 
a very fine cat indeed.)
