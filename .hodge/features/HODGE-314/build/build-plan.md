# Build Plan: HODGE-314

## Feature Overview
**PM Issue**: HODGE-314 (linear)
**Status**: Complete
**Implementation**: Template-only enhancement (no CLI changes)

## Implementation Checklist

### Core Implementation
- [x] Update .claude/commands/explore.md with conversational exploration flow
- [x] Add Phase 1: Context Loading (required steps)
- [x] Add Phase 2: Conversational Discovery with coverage areas
- [x] Add Phase 3: Conversation Synthesis & Preview
- [x] Add Phase 4: Traditional Approach Generation (fallback)
- [x] Include inline documentation

### Integration
- [x] Maintained compatibility with existing /explore workflow
- [x] No CLI/API endpoint changes required
- [x] No new dependencies needed

### Quality Checks
- [x] Follow coding standards (template updates only)
- [x] Used established pattern: progressive enhancement
- [x] Added comprehensive smoke tests
- [x] Considered edge cases (simple vs complex features, error handling)

## Files Modified
- `.claude/commands/explore.md` - Added conversational exploration flow with 4 phases, coverage areas, conversation guidelines, preview format, and error handling
- `src/lib/claude-commands-conversational.smoke.test.ts` - Created 6 smoke tests to validate template structure and required sections

## Decisions Implemented
All 6 decisions from /decide phase implemented:
1. ✅ Mix of required steps and flexible guidance - Phases 1-3 are required, Phase 4 is fallback
2. ✅ Required coverage areas (what/why/gotchas/tests) - Explicitly listed in Phase 2
3. ✅ Summary with key sections highlighted - Preview format in Phase 3
4. ✅ Scoped to /explore only - No changes to other slash commands
5. ✅ Conversation stored as synthesized prose - Instructions in Phase 3
6. ✅ User can provide direction or request restart - Error handling guidelines included

## Testing Notes
✅ All 6 smoke tests passing:
- Conversational exploration section exists
- Required coverage areas present (What/Why, Gotchas, Test Intentions)
- Conversation guidelines included (natural dialogue, summaries, options, scaling)
- Preview format instructions present with approval options
- Error handling guidance included (user control)
- Backward compatibility fallback maintained (Phase 4)

## Next Steps
Implementation complete! Ready for:
1. ✅ Smoke tests pass - `npm run test:smoke`
2. Proceed to `/harden HODGE-314` for integration testing
3. Test with real features to validate conversation flow
4. Gather lessons for potential improvements
