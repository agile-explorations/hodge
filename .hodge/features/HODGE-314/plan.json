  "title": "Interactive conversational exploration for /explore slash command",
  "description": "Transform /explore into an interactive, conversational experience where AI asks clarifying questions to deeply understand features before documenting.\n\nImplementation Approach:\n- Template-only enhancement (no CLI changes)\n- Update .claude/commands/explore.md with conversation instructions\n- Required steps: conversation flow, context loading, preview approval\n- Flexible guidance: question depth adapts to feature complexity\n\nDecisions Implemented:\n1. Mix of required steps and flexible guidance for template structure\n2. Define required coverage areas (what/why/gotchas/tests)\n3. Summary with key sections highlighted for preview\n4. Scoped to /explore only (not /build, /decide, /ship)\n5. Store conversation in exploration.md as synthesized prose\n6. User can provide direction or request restart for error handling",
