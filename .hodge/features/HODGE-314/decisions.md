# Feature Decisions: HODGE-314

This file tracks decisions specific to HODGE-314.

## Decisions

<!-- Add your decisions below -->

### 2025-10-02 - User can manually provide direction or request restart for error handling - preserves user control during conversation, allows natural course correction when AI goes off track, simple implementation without complex state management, user can guide AI or ask to restart exploration if needed

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
Feature: HODGE-314

**Decision**:

**Rationale**:
Recorded via `hodge decide` command at 12:23:36 AM

**Consequences**:
To be determined based on implementation.

### 2025-10-02 - Store conversation in exploration

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
Feature: HODGE-314

**Decision**:
Store conversation in exploration.md only as synthesized prose - provides clean professional documentation with single source of truth, easier to read and review, keeps exploration.md focused, conversation synthesis captures key points without raw Q&A duplication

**Rationale**:
Recorded via `hodge decide` command at 12:22:51 AM

**Consequences**:
To be determined based on implementation.

### 2025-10-02 - Keep HODGE-314 scoped to /explore only, defer other commands to future work - validates conversational pattern in one place before scaling, allows gathering lessons from real usage, reduces risk and scope, future features can apply pattern to /build, /decide, /ship after validation

**Status**: Accepted

### 2025-10-02 - Summary with key sections highlighted for preview format - provides concise review of exploration

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
Feature: HODGE-314

**Decision**:
Summary with key sections highlighted for preview format - provides concise review of exploration.md with important parts (Title, Problem Statement, Recommended Approach, Test Intentions count, Decisions count) highlighted for efficient approval, balances thoroughness with user time

**Rationale**:
Recorded via `hodge decide` command at 12:20:47 AM

**Consequences**:
To be determined based on implementation.

### 2025-10-02 - Define required coverage areas for conversation quality - AI must cover what/why/gotchas/tests during exploration to ensure comprehensive understanding, provides measurable quality criteria while allowing flexibility in how each area is explored

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**:
Feature: HODGE-314

**Decision**:
Define required coverage areas for conversation quality - AI must cover what/why/gotchas/tests during exploration to ensure comprehensive understanding, provides measurable quality criteria while allowing flexibility in how each area is explored

**Rationale**:
Recorded via `hodge decide` command at 12:18:55 AM

**Consequences**:
To be determined based on implementation.

---


### 2025-10-02 - Mix of required steps and flexible guidance for template structure - required steps ensure quality baseline (conversation flow, context loading, preview approval) while flexible guidance allows AI to adapt question depth and style to feature complexity

**Status**: Accepted
