  "commitMessage": "feat: add interactive conversational exploration to /explore command (HODGE-314)\n\n## What Changed\n- **/.claude/commands/explore.md** (136 lines modified)\n  - Added 4-phase conversational exploration flow\n  - Phase 1: Context Loading (patterns, lessons, decisions)\n  - Phase 2: Conversational Discovery (what/why/gotchas/tests)\n  - Phase 3: Conversation Synthesis & Preview with approval\n  - Phase 4: Traditional Approach Generation (fallback)\n  - Replaced static template generation with interactive dialogue\n\n- **/src/lib/claude-commands-conversational.smoke.test.ts** (new file, 6 tests)\n  - Validates conversational exploration section structure\n  - Tests required coverage areas (what/why/gotchas/tests)\n  - Verifies conversation guidelines and preview format\n  - Ensures error handling guidance present\n  - Confirms backward compatibility fallback exists\n\n- **Test Updates** (3 files modified)\n  - src/commands/context.smoke.test.ts: Fixed test isolation (uses generic feature names)\n  - src/test/decide-command.smoke.test.ts: Updated for HODGE-314 template structure\n  - src/test/explore-no-approach-generation.smoke.test.ts: Updated for conversational flow\n\n- **Template Sync**\n  - src/lib/claude-commands.ts: Auto-synced with explore.md changes\n\n## Why This Change\nThe /explore command previously generated static templates without deep understanding of features. This led to incomplete explorations, missed edge cases, and surprises during build. The new conversational approach ensures AI asks clarifying questions about requirements, gotchas, and test intentions before documenting, resulting in higher-quality explorations and better implementations.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n- **Template-only enhancement** - Zero CLI code changes required\n- **All 6 decisions from /decide phase implemented**:\n  1. âœ… Mix of required steps + flexible guidance\n  2. âœ… Required coverage areas (what/why/gotchas/tests)\n  3. âœ… Summary preview with key sections highlighted  \n  4. âœ… Scoped to /explore only (not other commands)\n  5. âœ… Conversation stored as synthesized prose\n  6. âœ… User can provide direction or restart\n\n## Impact\n- âœ… **Better feature understanding**: AI asks questions to deeply understand features before documenting\n- âœ… **Fewer surprises**: Gotchas and edge cases identified during exploration, not build\n- âœ… **Comprehensive test intentions**: Behavioral expectations finalized during conversation\n- âœ… **User approval required**: Preview shown before writing to exploration.md\n- âœ… **Error recovery**: User can guide or restart conversation if it goes off track\n- âœ… **Backward compatible**: Fallback to traditional approach when needed\n- âœ… **All tests passing**: 249 smoke tests + 6 new conversational template tests\n- âœ… **Zero breaking changes**: Template enhancement only, no CLI modifications\n\nCloses HODGE-314\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
