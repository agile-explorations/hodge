  "commitMessage": "fix: add prettier formatting to sync-claude-commands.js (HODGE-303)\n\n## What Changed\n- Modified scripts/sync-claude-commands.js (10 lines added)\n  - Added prettier formatting step after TypeScript generation\n  - Graceful error handling with try/catch and warnings\n  - Uses stdio: 'pipe' to suppress prettier output\n\n- Created scripts/sync-claude-commands.test.ts (NEW - 107 lines)\n  - 6 comprehensive smoke tests\n  - Tests cover: valid TypeScript, formatting, performance, content preservation, consistency, error handling\n  - Uses backup/restore pattern for test isolation\n\n## Why This Change\nThe GitHub Actions \"Quality Checks\" workflow was failing on prettier check while \nlocal checks passed. Root cause: the build script runs `npm run sync:commands` \nwhich regenerates src/lib/claude-commands.ts, but the generated code wasn't \nformatted, causing CI to fail after build step.\n\nFlow was:\n- CI: checkout → build (regenerates file with different formatting) → prettier ❌\n- Local: build (already done) → prettier check on uncommitted version ✅\n\nThis fix ensures generated code is always properly formatted in both CI and \nlocal environments by running prettier automatically during code generation.\n\n## Impact\n- ✅ CI prettier checks now pass after build step\n- ✅ No uncommitted changes after running build\n- ✅ Zero developer friction (automatic formatting)\n- ✅ Consistent formatting across environments\n- ✅ Graceful degradation if prettier fails\n- ✅ All 611 tests passing (including 6 new smoke tests)\n- ✅ Build time impact negligible (<100ms for prettier)\n\nCloses HODGE-303\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
