# Test Intentions for Claude Commands Sync

## What We Will Test
- [ ] Sync script correctly reads all `.claude/commands/*.md` files
- [ ] Generated TypeScript maintains correct structure
- [ ] All 9 commands are included in output
- [ ] Content is properly escaped for TypeScript strings
- [ ] Build process runs sync automatically
- [ ] Fresh installations get updated commands

## What We Won't Test
- [ ] Manual file editing (one-time operation)
- [ ] Command content correctness (separate concern)

## Validation Approach
- Run sync script and verify output
- Test `hodge init` with fresh install
- Ensure no runtime errors with new format
- Check that progressive testing guidance is included

## Success Criteria
- All commands stay synchronized automatically
- No manual intervention needed after editing `.claude/commands`
- Build process handles sync transparently
- New installations get latest command updates
