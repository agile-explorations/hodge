## Quality Checks Analysis

All tool-based quality checks passed:

✅ **Vitest Tests**: 122 test files passing, 1254 tests passing
✅ **Prettier**: All files properly formatted
✅ **Code Duplication (jscpd)**: No duplicated code detected
✅ **Dependency Architecture**: No circular dependencies (orphan warnings for .hodge files are expected)

## Standards Compliance Review

### ✅ Project Standards (`.hodge/standards.md`)
**All MANDATORY standards followed**:
- ✅ CLI Architecture Standards: Template-only changes, no CLI code modified
- ✅ Testing Requirements: Smoke tests use proper pattern (no subprocess spawning, test isolation)
- ✅ File Length Standards: Test file 179 lines (well under 300 line limit)
- ✅ TODO Convention: No TODOs in production code
- ✅ Logging Standards: N/A (no code changes)

### ✅ Project Principles (`.hodge/principles.md`)
**Alignment with core philosophy**:
- ✅ Progressive Enhancement: Template changes support explore → decide → build → ship workflow
- ✅ Structured Flexibility: Balances framework guidance with conversational discovery
- ✅ Behavior-Focused Testing: Tests verify template structure, not implementation details
- ✅ Transparent Progress: Clear documentation of changes and rationale

### ✅ Test Pattern Standards (`.hodge/patterns/test-pattern.md`)
**Critical rules followed**:
- ✅ NO subprocess spawning (HODGE-317.1/HODGE-319.1 compliance)
- ✅ Test isolation (tests read files from project, don't modify state)
- ✅ Service class extraction not needed (template-only changes)
- ✅ Smoke test pattern correctly applied (quick sanity checks)

### ✅ UX Pattern Standards (`claude-code-slash-commands.yaml`)
**Template compliance**:
- ✅ Interaction start box: Maintained existing pattern
- ✅ Conversation pacing: Turn count hints added (5-7 exchanges)
- ✅ Pattern consistency: Changes align with other slash command templates
- ✅ Knowledgeable peer tone: Conversational language maintained

### ✅ Testing Standards (`vitest-3.x.yaml`, `general-test-standards.yaml`)
**Test quality**:
- ✅ Test organization: Clear describe/it structure with descriptive names
- ✅ Assertion quality: Specific assertions using toContain for template structure
- ✅ Test isolation: No shared state between tests
- ✅ Test performance: Fast smoke tests (<100ms each)

### ✅ TypeScript Standards (`typescript-5.x.yaml`)
**Language compliance**:
- ✅ Strict mode: Test file passes TypeScript strict checking
- ✅ Type inference: Proper use of TypeScript type inference
- ✅ No any types: No use of any in test code

### ✅ Coding Standards (`general-coding-standards.yaml`)
**Code quality**:
- ✅ Single responsibility: Each test validates one aspect of template
- ✅ Naming consistency: Descriptive test names explain behavior
- ✅ No code duplication: Tests use DRY pattern with readFileSync helper
- ✅ Error handling: N/A for template tests

## Template Changes Analysis

### "What" vs "How" Decision Framework
**Added to explore.md (lines 119-144)**:
- ✅ Clear distinction between exploration topics and implementation details
- ✅ Concrete examples with checkmarks (✅ explore, ❌ defer to /decide)
- ✅ Rationale provided for each example (e.g., "affects API capabilities")
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of common decision types

**Standard Alignment**: Follows Structured Flexibility principle - provides framework guidance without being rigid.

### Conversation Pacing Guidance
**Added to explore.md (lines 176-178)**:
- ✅ Soft turn count hint: "Aim for 5-7 exchanges"
- ✅ Flexibility emphasized: "conclude earlier if understanding is complete"
- ✅ No rigid minimum or maximum enforced
- ✅ Natural conversation flow preserved

**Standard Alignment**: Balances structure with conversational discovery.

### Complexity Signals Section
**Added to explore.md (lines 180-191)**:
- ✅ Five specific signals identified (multiple components, long conversations, user cues, integration complexity, unclear dependencies)
- ✅ Clear threshold: "2+ complexity signals" triggers recommendation
- ✅ Explicit template for recommending `/plan`
- ✅ Helps AI recognize when feature breakdown is beneficial

**Standard Alignment**: Supports Progressive Development principle.

### Test Intention Depth Guidance
**Added to explore.md (lines 166-168)**:
- ✅ Differentiates parent features (high-level) from sub-features (specific)
- ✅ Concrete examples provided (HODGE-348 vs HODGE-348.1)
- ✅ Clear guidance on appropriate level of detail per context
- ✅ Aligns with progressive workflow (parent → /plan → sub-features)

**Standard Alignment**: Supports test behavior, not implementation principle.

## Test Coverage Analysis

**14 comprehensive smoke tests** verify all template changes:
- ✅ "What" vs "How" framework section exists
- ✅ Concrete examples of "what" decisions included
- ✅ Concrete examples of "how" decisions to defer
- ✅ Checkmark/x-mark examples with rationale
- ✅ FOCUS statement about "what" vs "how"
- ✅ Soft turn count hint in conversation guidelines
- ✅ Stop before "how" details guidance
- ✅ Complexity signals section exists
- ✅ Five specific complexity signals listed
- ✅ Recommendation threshold (2+ signals) documented
- ✅ /plan recommendation template included
- ✅ Test intention depth guidance included
- ✅ Parent vs sub-feature differentiation
- ✅ Examples of different test intention depths

**Test Quality**: All tests follow behavior-focused testing principle - they verify template structure (what users see) not implementation details.

## Conclusion

✅ **All files meet project standards. Ready to proceed with harden validation.**

This feature represents a **template-only enhancement** with:
- Zero code changes (only markdown template and smoke tests)
- Comprehensive test coverage (14 tests verify all changes)
- Full alignment with project standards and principles
- All quality gates passing

**Recommended Next Step**: Proceed with `hodge harden HODGE-348` to complete validation workflow.
