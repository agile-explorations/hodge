# ⚠️ INVALID STATE - HODGE-006

This feature is in an invalid state due to accidental data loss on 2025-09-19.

## What was lost:
- Enhanced exploration with 3 implementation approaches
- Detailed test intentions for LocalPMAdapter
- Updated context.json with PM-tracking intent
- Feature HODGE.md file
- Merged content from HODGE-006-local-pm-tracking directory

## Current state:
- Generic auto-generated exploration files only
- Implementation code exists (LocalPMAdapter, PMHooks)
- Decision recorded but exploration doesn't match

## Action required:
- Re-explore this feature properly before continuing
- Or restore the enhanced exploration content

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH THIS FEATURE WITHOUT FIXING THE EXPLORATION**
