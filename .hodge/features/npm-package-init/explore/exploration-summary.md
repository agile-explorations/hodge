# NPM Package Initialization Exploration

## Approach 1: Standard ES Modules
**File:** `approach-1-standard-esm.json`

### Implementation
- Pure JavaScript with ES modules (`"type": "module"`)
- Native Node.js testing (`node --test`)
- Minimal dependencies
- Simple build process

### Pros
- ✅ Simplest setup, fastest to start
- ✅ No build step required for development
- ✅ Native Node.js features (no transpilation)
- ✅ Matches IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md tech stack exactly
- ✅ Easiest to debug (no source maps needed)

### Cons
- ❌ No type safety during development
- ❌ Harder to refactor as codebase grows
- ❌ Less IDE support for autocomplete

### Compatibility
- Perfect match with planned tech stack (Node.js 18+, Commander.js)
- Ready for immediate development

---

## Approach 2: TypeScript-Ready
**File:** `approach-2-typescript.json`

### Implementation
- TypeScript from the start
- Vitest for testing (better than Jest for ESM)
- Strong typing with Zod for runtime validation
- TSX for development (fast transpilation)

### Pros
- ✅ Type safety catches bugs early
- ✅ Excellent IDE support
- ✅ Better for long-term maintenance
- ✅ Easier refactoring with types
- ✅ Runtime validation with Zod

### Cons
- ❌ Requires build step
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Not specified in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- ❌ Potential source map issues

### Compatibility
- Would require updating tech stack decision
- Adds complexity not in original plan

---

## Approach 3: Monorepo-Compatible
**File:** `approach-3-monorepo.json`

### Implementation
- Workspace configuration for future packages
- Changesets for version management
- Multiple export paths for modular usage
- ESBuild for fast bundling

### Pros
- ✅ Future-proof for splitting into packages
- ✅ Better for plugin architecture
- ✅ Professional versioning with changesets
- ✅ Can add examples/templates as workspaces

### Cons
- ❌ Over-engineered for current needs
- ❌ More complex npm scripts
- ❌ Workspace overhead for single package

### Compatibility
- Could support future plugin system
- Might be premature optimization

---

## Recommendation

**Go with Approach 1: Standard ES Modules**

### Reasoning
1. **Matches the plan**: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md explicitly specifies JavaScript with ES modules
2. **Speed to market**: Can start implementing immediately without setup overhead
3. **Dogfooding philosophy**: Hodge promotes starting simple and evolving based on needs
4. **Native Node.js**: Leverages Node.js 18+ features without transpilation
5. **Easy migration**: Can add TypeScript later if needed (progressive enhancement)

### Implementation Strategy
```bash
# Use Approach 1 as base
cp .hodge/features/npm-package-init/explore/approach-1-standard-esm.json package.json

# Initialize immediately
npm install

# Start with core CLI
mkdir -p bin lib
echo '#!/usr/bin/env node' > bin/hodge.js
```

### Future Considerations
- Can add TypeScript in Week 4-5 if complexity demands it
- Can evolve to monorepo if plugin system emerges
- Keeps options open while shipping fast

## Next Steps
To move to build mode: `/build npm-package-init`

This will:
1. Create the actual package.json
2. Install dependencies
3. Set up initial file structure
4. Prepare for git initialization
