# Exploration: HODGE-288

## Feature Overview
**PM Issue**: HODGE-288
**Type**: general
**Created**: 2025-09-23T06:22:09.777Z

## Context
- **Standards**: Loaded (suggested only)
- **Available Patterns**: 9
- **Similar Features**: hodge-branding, HODGE-001, HODGE-002
- **Relevant Patterns**: None identified
- **Existing Work**: Found prior exploration in `.hodge/features/pm-adapter-hooks/explore/exploration.md`
- **Current Implementation**: PMHooks class exists in `src/lib/pm/pm-hooks.ts`

## Problem Analysis
The PM integration system needs improvements:
- PMHooks class exists but has limited hook points
- Linear adapter errors are not properly handled
- No support for GitHub Issues or Jira
- Missing hooks for decide, save, and status commands
- No configurable workflow mappings
- External PM updates fail silently

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Enhanced Hook System
Extend the existing PMHooks class with more comprehensive hook points:
- Add hooks for ALL commands (decide, save, status, context, etc.)
- Implement retry logic for failed PM updates
- Add queue for offline/failed updates
- Create hook middleware system for plugins

**Pros:**
- Builds on existing infrastructure
- Backwards compatible
- Incremental improvement possible
- Maintains current architecture

**Cons:**
- Still tightly coupled to commands
- Limited extensibility
- Hard to test in isolation

### Approach 2: Event-Driven Architecture
Replace direct hooks with an event bus system:
- Commands emit events (explore.started, build.completed, etc.)
- PM adapters subscribe to relevant events
- Async processing with retry queue
- Plugin architecture for custom handlers

**Pros:**
- Loose coupling between commands and PM
- Easy to add new integrations
- Can record events for replay
- Testable in isolation

**Cons:**
- More complex architecture
- Potential timing issues
- Requires significant refactoring

### Approach 3: Hybrid Progressive Enhancement (Recommended)
Enhance PMHooks while preparing for future event system:
- Keep PMHooks for immediate needs
- Add comprehensive hook coverage
- Implement adapter registry pattern
- Create foundation for future event system
- Add configuration-driven workflow mappings

**Pros:**
- Immediate improvements without breaking changes
- Sets foundation for future architecture
- Allows incremental migration
- Maintains simplicity while adding power

**Cons:**
- Some temporary code that will be replaced
- Not as elegant as pure event system

## Recommendation
**Recommended Approach: Hybrid Progressive Enhancement**

This approach provides immediate value while setting up for long-term architectural improvements. We can enhance the current PMHooks system to be more robust and comprehensive, while designing it in a way that makes future migration to an event-driven system straightforward.

## Decisions Needed
1. **Hook Coverage**: Which commands need PM hooks? (all vs critical only)
2. **Error Handling**: How to handle PM update failures? (retry, queue, ignore)
3. **Configuration Format**: How to configure workflow mappings?
4. **Adapter Priority**: Which PM tool to support next? (GitHub, Jira, Notion)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review exploration findings
- [ ] Use `/decide` to make implementation decisions
- [ ] Proceed to `/build HODGE-288`
