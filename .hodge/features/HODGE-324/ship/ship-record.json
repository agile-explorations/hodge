  "commitMessage": "fix: ensure lessons learned are committed with feature work (HODGE-324)\n\n## What Changed\n\n**Core Bug Fix** (2 files, net -109 lines):\n- .claude/commands/ship.md: Restructured workflow to capture lessons BEFORE commit\n  - Moved Step 5 (lessons enhancement) to new Step 3.5 (before ship execution)\n  - Changed from post-commit draft generation to pre-commit finalized lessons\n  - Updated to create lessons directly at `.hodge/lessons/{feature}-{slug}.md`\n  - Removed references to `lessons-draft.md` (no longer generated)\n  \n- src/commands/ship.ts: Removed post-commit draft generation\n  - Deleted `generateLessonsDraft()` method (~98 lines removed)\n  - Removed call to draft generation after commit (line 301)\n  - Added comment explaining lessons now handled in slash command\n  - Slash command owns entire lessons workflow\n\n**Test Updates** (2 files, net -58 lines):\n- src/test/ship-lessons.smoke.test.ts: Deleted obsolete draft generation tests\n- src/test/documentation-hierarchy.smoke.test.ts: Updated to reflect new workflow\n\n**Template Sync** (1 file):\n- src/lib/claude-commands.ts: Auto-synced from ship.md template changes\n\n**Metadata Updates** (6 files):\n- .hodge/HODGE.md: Updated feature status to \"harden\"\n- .hodge/.session: Session state synchronized\n- .hodge/context.json, id-counter.json, id-mappings.json: PM tracking updates\n- .hodge/project_management.md: Linear integration sync\n\n**New Test Coverage** (1 new file):\n- src/commands/hodge-324.smoke.test.ts: Added 14 smoke tests validating the fix\n\n## Why This Change\n\nThe `/ship` command was generating lessons learned AFTER the git commit executed, which meant lessons were never committed with the feature work that generated them. This violated the principle of keeping project knowledge in version control and created orphaned lesson files.\n\nRoot cause: Template had lessons enhancement (Step 5) after `hodge ship` execution (Step 4), and CLI generated draft files post-commit.\n\n## Implementation\n\n**New Flow**:\n1. Steps 1-3: Analyze changes, generate commit message, get approval\n2. **Step 3.5 (NEW)**: Ask \"Want to document lessons? (y/n)\"\n   - If yes: Ask enhancement questions, create finalized lesson at `.hodge/lessons/`\n   - If no: Skip to Step 4\n3. Step 4: Run `hodge ship` \n   - `git add -A` stages all files (including lessons if created)\n   - Creates git commit\n4. Post-Ship Actions\n\n**Design Decisions** (7 formalized via `/decide`):\n- Lessons captured between Step 3 and Step 4 (before commit)\n- Only finalized lesson committed (no draft clutter)\n- Lessons remain optional (user choice)\n- CLI responsibility removed (slash command owns workflow)\n- No files created if user skips\n- Existing `git add -A` handles staging\n- Simple upfront y/n prompt\n\n## Impact\n\n✅ **Bug Fixed**: Lessons are now committed with feature work automatically\n✅ **Cleaner Workspace**: No orphaned draft files\n✅ **Better Architecture**: Clean separation - slash command (AI) handles interaction, CLI handles mechanics\n✅ **Version Control**: Project knowledge stays in git history\n✅ **Net Deletion**: -190 lines of unnecessary code removed\n✅ **Test Coverage**: 14 new smoke tests validate the fix\n✅ **User Experience**: Simple linear flow with optional lessons\n\n**Files Changed**: 11 modified, 1 deleted, 1 new test file\n**Net Impact**: -190 lines (code cleanup)\n\nCloses HODGE-324"
