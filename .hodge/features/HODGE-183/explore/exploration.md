## Recommended Approaches


### Approach 1: Standard Implementation (70% relevant)
**Description**: Implement HODGE-183 following existing project patterns

**Pros**:
- Consistent with codebase
- Uses proven patterns
- Easy for team to understand

**Cons**:
- May not be optimal for specific use case
- Could miss optimization opportunities


## Recommendation
Based on the analysis, **Standard Implementation** appears most suitable because:
- Highest relevance score (70%)
- Aligns with detected intent (general)

## Root Cause Analysis
The /ship command was not calling `git commit` in Claude Code environment because:
1. The CLI command tried to handle both interactive UI and git operations
2. In Claude Code, it would write a markdown file but couldn't display it
3. It would return early (line 339) waiting for user edits that never happened
4. The git commit code (lines 516-563) was never reached

## Solution
Implement proper separation of concerns following Hybrid Progressive Enhancement:
- **Claude Code ship.md**: Handle interactive commit message generation and approval
- **hodge ship CLI**: Accept pre-approved messages via --message flag and handle git operations

## Implementation Hints
- The --message flag already exists in ShipOptions interface
- The CLI already skips interaction when message is provided
- Update ship.md to generate message and call CLI with --message flag
- This follows the architectural principle: AI handles interaction, CLI handles operations

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review the recommended approaches
- [ ] Consider similar features for inspiration
- [ ] Make decision with `/decide`
- [ ] Proceed to `/build HODGE-183`
