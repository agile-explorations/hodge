  "commitMessage": "fix: eliminate HODGE.md generation and fix subprocess spawning regression (HODGE-319.1)\n\n## What Changed\n- **Phase 1: Core Implementation** (7 files)\n  - src/commands/build.ts: Fixed decision file path bug (exploreDir â†’ featureDir), removed HODGE.md generation\n  - src/commands/explore.ts: Removed HODGE.md generation and phase-specific context.json creation\n  - src/commands/harden.ts: Removed HODGE.md generation\n  - src/commands/ship.ts: Removed HODGE.md generation and backup/restore logic\n  - src/commands/ship-clean-tree.*.test.ts: Updated 2 tests to reflect HODGE.md removal\n  - src/commands/hodge-319.1.smoke.test.ts: NEW - Added 8 comprehensive smoke tests\n\n- **Phase 2: Subprocess Spawning Regression Fix** (3 files)\n  - src/test/commonjs-compatibility.integration.test.ts: Redesigned 6 tests to eliminate execSync() subprocess spawning (222 lines refactored)\n  - .hodge/standards.md: Added \"Subprocess Spawning Ban\" as CRITICAL standard\n  - .hodge/patterns/test-pattern.md: Added subprocess spawning ban documentation with examples\n\n- **Phase 3: Test Compatibility** (1 file)\n  - src/commands/explore.new-style.test.ts: Removed context.json expectation (eliminated in Phase 1)\n\n## Why This Change\n**Original Problem**: The /build command checked for decision files in the wrong location (exploreDir instead of featureDir), and HODGE.md/context.json files were being generated per-phase but never used, creating unnecessary file clutter.\n\n**Discovered Regression**: During harden phase, tests were timing out and creating hung Node processes. Investigation revealed that HODGE-318's commonjs-compatibility tests had reintroduced subprocess spawning via execSync(), directly violating the fix from HODGE-317.1 that eliminated this exact pattern.\n\n**Root Cause**: Subprocess spawning creates orphaned zombie processes that hang indefinitely, requiring manual kill in Activity Monitor. HODGE-317.1 (2025-09-30) fixed this, but HODGE-318 (2025-10-01) inadvertently reintroduced it.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n1. **Quick Wins**: Fixed path bug, removed unused file generation (7 files)\n2. **Regression Discovery**: Found subprocess spawning during test runs\n3. **Thorough Fix**: Redesigned tests to verify artifacts instead of runtime (HODGE-317.1 pattern)\n4. **Future-Proofing**: Documented ban in standards.md and test-pattern.md with historical context\n\n## Impact\n- âœ… **Test Suite Health**: 679 passing (was 667), 0 failing (was 9), 100% success rate\n- âœ… **No Timeouts**: Tests complete in 10.99s (vs 5s+ timeouts before)\n- âœ… **Zero Hung Processes**: Subprocess spawning eliminated (no more manual kills needed)\n- âœ… **Cleaner Workflow**: No unnecessary HODGE.md or context.json files per phase\n- âœ… **Bug Fixed**: /build now checks correct decision file location\n- âœ… **Future-Proofed**: CRITICAL standard documented to prevent future regressions\n- âœ… **+12 tests**: 8 new HODGE-319.1 smoke tests + 6 redesigned commonjs tests\n\nCloses HODGE-319.1\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
