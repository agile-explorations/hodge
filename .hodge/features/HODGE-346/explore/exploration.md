# Exploration: Unified UX System for Claude Code Slash Commands

**Title**: Unified UX System for Claude Code Slash Commands

**Feature**: HODGE-346
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Exploration Complete

---

## Problem Statement

The Claude Code custom slash commands (`.claude/commands/*.md`) currently lack consistency in user experience design. Analysis of all 10 command files reveals significant UX inconsistencies that create cognitive friction:

- **Inconsistent option formatting**: Varies between `(a)`, `**a)**`, and `a)` across different commands
- **Varying response indicators**: Some use boxes (`════`), others use emojis (`⚠️`), some use plain headers
- **Unclear recommendations**: Recommended options not consistently marked across commands
- **Mixed next steps presentation**: Sometimes alphabetized lists, sometimes bulleted, sometimes numbered
- **No standard interaction start pattern**: Each command uses different visual styles
- **Mixed slash command suggestions**: Sometimes presented as choice lists, sometimes inline text
- **No celebration moments**: Despite user achievements, no acknowledgment of progress or wins
- **No learning from patterns**: Commands don't adapt based on user preferences or project velocity
- **Verbose context loading**: Procedural rather than intelligent and context-aware

This creates a suboptimal experience where users must relearn interaction patterns with each command, reducing efficiency and delight in AI-human collaboration.

---

## Conversation Summary

Through detailed conversational exploration, we identified specific design requirements and analyzed the current implementation across three key commands (`/decide`, `/explore`, `/harden`).

### Current State Analysis

**Command-Specific Findings**:
- `/harden`: 7+ numbered steps with inconsistent section formatting between steps
- `/decide`: Uses alphabetized option lists at end but numbered decisions during flow (inconsistent)
- `/explore`: "Next Steps Menu" includes strict template compliance warnings that feel rigid

**Pain Point Categories**:
1. **Visual inconsistency**: Response indicators vary widely (boxes, emojis, headers, warnings)
2. **No intelligent adaptation**: Commands don't adjust based on project state or user patterns
3. **Missing delight**: No celebration of achievements, progress tracking, or streak recognition
4. **Error handling gaps**: No collaborative recovery when users express uncertainty or confusion
5. **Information overload**: Complex multi-step commands lack clear progress indicators

### Design Requirements Gathered

**Core UX Patterns** (from user requirements):
- Alphabetized choice lists for user selections (a/b/c/d format)
- Single-keystroke responses with optional modification ("a" or "a, but add X")
- Clear recommendation marking on suggested options
- Emoji-based response indicators with consistent text ("YOUR RESPONSE NEEDED")
- Bulleted lists for slash command suggestions (not alphabetized, since they must be typed)
- Smart context-aware filtering (hide irrelevant commands)
- Read code before asking implementation questions

**Intelligence Requirements** (from user preferences):
- **All three levels of context awareness**:
  - Basic: Hide irrelevant commands (e.g., no `/decide` if no decisions needed)
  - Predictive: Anticipate next logical step and highlight it
  - Adaptive: Reshape interaction based on project state (e.g., "I notice 3 TODOs...")
- **Collaborative error recovery**: AI proactively notices confusion and offers help
- **Hybrid information density**: Overview at start, then progressive disclosure with breadcrumbs
- **Knowledgeable peer tone**: Conversational, smart, occasionally witty

**Delight Features** (user wanted "all of the above"):
- Smart shortcuts: Learn user patterns, offer one-keystroke commands for common flows
- Progress celebration: Acknowledge wins, show momentum ("3 features shipped this week! 🎉")
- Contextual tips: "I notice you're in harden mode - here's a pattern from HODGE-123"
- Achievement tracking: Streaks, badges, milestone recognition

## Recommendation

**Approach 1: The Conversational Companion** is the recommended choice.

**Rationale**:

1. **Balanced Design**: Strikes the perfect middle ground between efficiency (Approach 2) and delight (Approach 3). Provides smart assistance without being overwhelming.

2. **Broad Appeal**: Clean, minimalist aesthetics with tasteful emoji usage appeals to both CLI veterans and modern developers. Not too playful, not too austere.

3. **Smart Without Overwhelm**: All three levels of context awareness (basic, predictive, adaptive) provide intelligent assistance when needed, but don't force interaction. If there's nothing smart to suggest, it stays quiet.

4. **Professional Yet Approachable**: Knowledgeable peer tone feels like pairing with a skilled colleague - helpful, occasionally witty, but never condescending or overly chatty.

5. **Scalable Personality**: Celebration and achievement features are present but calibrated to feel earned rather than gimmicky. Can be tuned up or down based on user feedback.

6. **Aligns with Hodge Philosophy**: The "freedom to explore, discipline to ship" philosophy is reflected in adaptive guidance that provides structure without rigidity.

7. **Maintainability**: Visual patterns are consistent but flexible enough to accommodate future commands. Box pattern with rounded corners provides clear visual hierarchy without being brittle.

8. **Accessibility**: Emoji usage is purposeful (response indicators, recommendations) but text alternatives ensure screen reader compatibility.

9. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core patterns work in basic terminals, while richer features (progress tracking, achievements) enhance the experience in modern environments.

10. **User Testing Potential**: The balanced approach makes it easier to A/B test specific elements (e.g., how much celebration is "just right?") without redesigning the entire system.

**Implementation Priority**:
1. **Phase 1**: Core visual language (interaction starts, response indicators, recommendation marking, alphabetized lists)
2. **Phase 2**: Smart context awareness (basic hiding, then predictive, then adaptive)
3. **Phase 3**: Collaborative error recovery
4. **Phase 4**: Progress celebration and achievement tracking
5. **Phase 5**: Smart shortcuts and pattern learning

This phased approach allows us to ship the core consistency improvements quickly while iterating on the more complex intelligence features.

**Implementation Requirements**:

1. **Review Profile Creation**: The selected UX design (Approach 1: Conversational Companion) must be documented as a review profile at `.hodge/review-profiles/ux-patterns/claude-code-slash-commands.yaml` and `.hodge/review-profiles/ux-patterns/claude-code-slash-commands.md`. This profile will enforce:
   - Visual hierarchy patterns (interaction starts, response indicators)
   - Option formatting standards (alphabetized lists, recommendation marking)
   - Slash command suggestion format (bulleted, context-aware)
   - Tone and personality guidelines (knowledgeable peer)
   - Context awareness requirements (basic, predictive, adaptive)
   - Error recovery patterns (collaborative repair)
   - Information density approach (hybrid with breadcrumbs)

2. **Profile Application**: All changes to `.claude/commands/*.md` files must be validated against this review profile using the Hodge review system.

3. **Standards Validation**: Before creating the review profile, we must search existing project documentation to ensure no conflicts:
   - `.hodge/standards.md` - Check for any UX or interaction patterns already defined
   - `.hodge/principles.md` - Verify alignment with Hodge philosophy
   - `.hodge/decisions.md` - Review past decisions that might affect UX design
   - `.hodge/patterns/*.md` - Check for existing interaction patterns

4. **Conflict Resolution**: If any conflicts are found between the new UX design and existing standards/principles/decisions/patterns, they must be:
   - Documented in the build phase
   - Resolved through explicit decisions (using `/decide`)
   - Updated in the relevant files to maintain consistency

---

## Test Intentions

These behavioral expectations define success for the unified UX system:

1. **Consistent Visual Hierarchy**: When any command requires user response, it displays the emoji-based indicator ("🔔 YOUR RESPONSE NEEDED") followed by content and choice prompt ("👉 Your choice [a/b/c/d]:")

2. **Alphabetized Choice Lists**: When presenting multiple options for user selection, all options are displayed as alphabetized lists (a, b, c, d, ...) that can be answered with single keystroke

3. **Clear Recommendations**: When one option is preferred, it includes the ⭐ emoji immediately after the letter and appends "(Recommended)" to the option text

4. **Bulleted Slash Commands**: When suggesting next slash commands, they appear as bulleted lists (•) with command first, then description, never as alphabetized choice lists

5. **Smart Command Filtering (Basic)**: When project state makes certain commands irrelevant (e.g., no decisions to make), those commands are omitted from "What's Next?" suggestions

6. **Predictive Suggestions**: When user patterns are detected (e.g., shipped 3 features this week), the next logical command is highlighted with context ("Suggested next based on your workflow")

7. **Adaptive Guidance**: When project state suggests proactive help (e.g., TODOs in exploration notes), system offers choices to address the condition before proceeding

8. **Collaborative Error Recovery**: When user input suggests uncertainty ("maybe b?") or is invalid ("7" when options are a-d), system offers helpful clarification options rather than just rejecting input

9. **Consistent Interaction Starts**: Every command begins with the box-with-rounded-corners pattern containing emoji + command purpose (e.g., "┌─────┐ │ 🔍 Exploring Feature │ └─────┘")

10. **Hybrid Information Display**: Complex multi-step commands show overview at start (all steps listed), then progressive disclosure with breadcrumbs ("📍 Step 3 of 7: Step Name")

11. **Progress Celebration**: When user ships a feature, system displays achievement box with stats (ships this week/month, test coverage) and any unlocked achievements

12. **Contextual Tips**: When user workflow matches a lesson from a previous feature, system offers optional tip with reference to the specific feature

13. **Smart Shortcuts**: When user consistently chooses the same option, system offers to make it the default with clear choice prompt

14. **Knowledgeable Peer Tone**: All AI-generated text uses conversational language ("Let me help clarify", "Here's what we'll do") rather than formal commands ("System will now", "User must")

15. **Pattern Consistency Across Commands**: All 10 slash command files follow the same visual patterns, tone, and interaction structures for option presentation, response indicators, and next steps

16. **Review Profile Enforcement**: When slash command files are modified, the Hodge review system validates changes against the UX review profile (`.hodge/review-profiles/ux-patterns/claude-code-slash-commands.yaml`) and reports violations

17. **No Conflicts with Existing Standards**: The UX design documented in the review profile does not contradict any rules in `.hodge/standards.md`, `.hodge/principles.md`, `.hodge/decisions.md`, or `.hodge/patterns/*.md`
