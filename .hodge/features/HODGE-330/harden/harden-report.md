You are now in SHIP MODE for: test-feature

SHIPPING REQUIREMENTS:
• Feature MUST be production-ready
• ALL tests MUST pass
• Documentation MUST be complete
• Code review SHOULD be done
• PM issue will be marked as Done
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Feature has been built but not hardened.
   Consider hardening first with:
   hodge harden test-feature

Use --skip-tests to bypass this check at your own risk.
