  "commitMessage": "feat(review): add manifest generation with file scoping support (HODGE-344.2)\n\nExtend manifest generator and add report saver for file-based reviews.\nThis enables the upcoming unified review command to work with arbitrary\nfile lists (--file, --directory, --last N) while maintaining backward\ncompatibility with feature-based workflows.\n\n## What Changed\n\n### Core Implementation (163 lines added)\n- **ReviewReportSaver** (src/lib/review-report-saver.ts, +155 lines)\n  - Standalone utility for saving review reports to .hodge/reviews/\n  - Timestamp-based naming: review-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md\n  - Scope metadata included in report headers\n  - buildReportContent() generates markdown with sections\n  - formatTimestamp() for consistent filename format\n  \n- **Enhanced Manifest Generator** (src/lib/review-manifest-generator.ts, +25 lines)\n  - Added optional fileList parameter (backward compatible)\n  - Added optional scope parameter for traceability\n  - When fileList provided, uses explicit files\n  - When omitted, falls back to existing git diff behavior\n  - Maintains single source of truth for manifest logic\n\n- **Scope Metadata Types** (src/types/review-manifest.ts, +17 lines)\n  - New ScopeMetadata interface tracking type/target/fileCount\n  - Four scope types: file | directory | commits | feature\n  - Optional scope field added to ReviewManifest interface\n  - Provides clear traceability for all review types\n\n### Testing (440 lines added)\n- **Report Saver Tests** (src/lib/review-report-saver.smoke.test.ts, +328 lines)\n  - 12 smoke tests covering timestamp formatting, file creation, content rendering\n  - Uses TempDirectoryFixture pattern for proper test isolation\n  - Verifies scope metadata inclusion in reports\n  - All tests passing\n  \n- **Manifest Generator Tests** (src/lib/review-manifest-generator.smoke.test.ts, +112 lines)\n  - 4 new smoke tests for scope metadata functionality\n  - Tests file scope, directory scope, commits scope\n  - Verifies backward compatibility (no scope when fileList omitted)\n  - 24 total tests passing (20 existing + 4 new)\n\n### Metadata Updates\n- Feature artifacts created (.hodge/features/HODGE-344.2/)\n- PM tracking updated (id-mappings.json, project_management.md)\n- Session tracking updated (.hodge/.session, HODGE.md, context.json)\n- Duplication report regenerated (1.36% duplication, acceptable)\n\n## Why This Change\n\n**Problem**: The unified review command (HODGE-344) needs to generate\nmanifests from arbitrary file lists, not just feature-based git diffs.\nThe existing manifest generator in /harden is tightly coupled to feature\ncontexts and staged files.\n\n**Solution**: Extended the manifest generator with optional parameters\nwhile maintaining backward compatibility. When fileList is provided, uses\nexplicit files; when omitted, falls back to git diff (existing behavior).\nCreated standalone report saver for .hodge/reviews/ persistence.\n\n**Architecture**: Building standalone utilities enables clean composition\nin ReviewEngineService (HODGE-344.3) without premature refactoring. Tool\nscoping pattern leverages existing ToolchainService.substituteFiles()\nwith ${files} placeholder.\n\n## Impact\n\n**For HODGE-344 Epic**:\n- âœ… Story 2 of 5 complete (manifest generation with file scoping)\n- Foundation ready for HODGE-344.3 (ReviewEngineService)\n- Backward compatible with existing /harden workflows\n\n**For Code Quality**:\n- All 1027 tests passing (100%)\n- Zero TypeScript errors (strict mode)\n- Zero ESLint errors (2 warnings, both acceptable)\n- Zero code duplication violations\n- 1.36% duplication detected (under 5% threshold)\n\n**For Developers**:\n- Single manifest generator works for both feature and file-based reviews\n- Clear scope metadata for traceability\n- Timestamp-based report naming prevents conflicts\n- Comprehensive smoke test coverage for confidence\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
