  "commitMessage": "refactor: separate project metadata from user configuration (metadata-clarity)\n\n## What Changed\n- Renamed .hodge/config.json to .hodge/project-meta.json for semantic clarity\n- Enhanced hodge.json with comprehensive default configuration (PM status mapping, ship settings, commit types)\n- Removed pmTool from metadata file (now exclusively in hodge.json)\n- Added explanatory headers to project-meta.json: \"This file contains auto-detected project metadata. DO NOT EDIT\"\n- Removed unnecessary ConfigManager.migrateConfig() method (no production deployments to migrate)\n- Updated 15 files including tests, structure generator, and config manager\n- Added 3 new smoke test suites (15 tests total) for configuration behavior\n- Fixed PM status mapping to use configuration defaults instead of hardcoded values\n\n## Why This Change\nThe previous naming (.hodge/config.json) was misleading - users thought it was configuration they should edit, when it actually contained auto-detected metadata. This separation makes the architecture clearer:\n- .env: Secrets and environment variables\n- hodge.json: User-editable configuration with visible defaults\n- .hodge/project-meta.json: Auto-detected metadata (DO NOT EDIT)\n\n## Impact\n- ‚ú® Users can now discover and customize PM status mappings in hodge.json\n- üìù Clearer file naming prevents user confusion about what to edit\n- üéØ All configuration defaults are now visible and customizable\n- üßπ Removed unnecessary migration code, simplifying the codebase\n- ‚úÖ Improved test coverage with dedicated smoke tests for each configuration aspect\n\n## Technical Details\n- ConfigManager now loads from project-meta.json for metadata (config-manager.ts:58)\n- StructureGenerator creates both files with clear separation (structure-generator.ts:245, 278)\n- PM hooks use configuration for status mapping instead of hardcoded values (pm-hooks.ts:107)\n- All tests updated to expect the new file structure"
