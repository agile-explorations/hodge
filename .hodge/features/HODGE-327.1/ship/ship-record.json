  "commitMessage": "feat: add review report persistence with metadata tracking (HODGE-327.1)\n\n## What Changed\n\n**Slash Command Template** (1 file, net +98 lines):\n- .claude/commands/review.md: Added Step 6 with save/discard prompt\n  - User prompt after review generation: \"Save report (s) or Discard (d)\"\n  - Filename generation logic (bash): converts file path to slug + timestamp\n  - Metadata extraction: parses report for finding counts by severity\n  - Feature detection: best-effort git blame analysis for HODGE-XXX context\n  - Write tool integration: saves report with YAML frontmatter to .hodge/reviews/\n\n**Auto-Generated Sync** (1 file, net +98 lines):\n- src/lib/claude-commands.ts: Template changes automatically synced\n\n**Standards Documentation** (1 file, net +34 lines):\n- .hodge/standards.md: Added \"Slash Command File Creation Pattern\" section\n  - Documents Write tool as standard for slash command file creation\n  - Clarifies AI writes content, CLI creates structure\n  - Examples: /explore, /ship, /review all use Write tool\n  - Explains why Service classes should NOT write files for slash commands\n\n**Build & Exploration Updates** (2 files, net +459 lines):\n- .hodge/features/HODGE-327.1/build/build-plan.md: Documented architectural pivot from Service class to template approach\n- .hodge/features/HODGE-327.1/explore/exploration.md: Appended revisited exploration with persistence design\n\n**Metadata Updates** (5 files):\n- .hodge/HODGE.md, .hodge/context.json, .hodge/project_management.md: Session and PM tracking synchronized\n- .hodge/id-mappings.json: PM integration updated\n- .hodge/features/HODGE-327.1/harden/: Harden validation results\n\n## Why This Change\n\nThe `/review` command displayed valuable architectural analysis reports but they vanished after user response, forcing manual copying or losing insights. Users needed persistent storage in `.hodge/reviews/` with metadata (timestamp, scope, profile, feature context, finding counts) to reference findings when fixing issues.\n\nKey architectural discovery during implementation: AI should write content files using the Write tool, NOT Service classes. This maintains clean separation (CLI = orchestration, AI = content generation) and follows established patterns from `/explore` and `/ship` commands.\n\n## Impact\n\n✅ **User Experience**:\n- Review reports can now be saved for future reference\n- Simple binary choice (save/discard) streamlines workflow\n- Metadata enables review history tracking and analysis\n- Feature detection links reviews to related HODGE work\n\n✅ **Code Quality**:\n- Follows established Hodge workflow patterns consistently\n- Write tool usage documented in standards.md\n- All harden validations passed (tests, lint, typecheck, build)\n- Template-only changes (no new TypeScript code to test)\n\n✅ **Architecture**:\n- Standardized file creation pattern across all slash commands\n- Prevented Service class proliferation for simple file operations\n- Enhanced standards.md prevents future pattern violations\n- Future-proof naming convention supports scope expansion (directory/pattern/recent/all)\n\nCloses HODGE-327.1 (enhancement to existing review feature)"
