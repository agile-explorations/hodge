# Feature Exploration: HODGE-349

**Title**: Consolidate `.hodge/` root files to eliminate redundancy and establish single source of truth for status information

**Status**: Exploring
**Created**: 2025-10-25

---

## Problem Statement

The `.hodge/` directory root contains 19 files (~2,600 lines) with significant redundancy. Status information appears in multiple places (HODGE.md, context.json, .session, .claude/CLAUDE.md), and several documentation files (AI-CONTEXT.md, CONTEXT-SCALING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md) contain content that should live in proper knowledge files (standards.md, principles.md, decisions.md). This creates maintenance burden and violates DRY principles.

## Conversation Summary

Conducted comprehensive audit of all `.hodge/` root files by:
1. Reading all 19 files to understand their content and purpose
2. Searching codebase for usage patterns (grep for file references)
3. Analyzing source code in hodge-md-generator.ts, context-manager.ts, session-manager.ts, toolchain-service.ts, config-manager.ts
4. Identifying which files are actively used vs dead code vs redundant

**Key Findings**:
- **Status Redundancy**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` duplicates 95% of `.hodge/HODGE.md` but is NOT generated by CLI (manual file)
- **Dead Code**: `project-meta.json` is loaded by ConfigManager but never actually used in config merging
- **Documentation Scattered**: AI-CONTEXT.md, CONTEXT-SCALING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md contain valuable content that belongs in standards.md, principles.md, decisions.md, or CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Misplaced Files**: `development-plan.json` is feature-specific (HODGE-346) but lives in root instead of `.hodge/features/HODGE-346/`

**User Requirements**:
- Q1: Single source of truth (option a) - even if it means updating CLI and templates
- Q2: Extract valuable content from documentation files before deletion
- Q3: Audit config files and consolidate if sensible

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Surgical Cleanup with Content Extraction ⭐ (Recommended)

**Description**: Systematically delete redundant files while extracting valuable content to proper knowledge files, maintaining single source of truth for all information.

**Steps**:
1. **DELETE redundant status files**:
   - `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (duplicate of HODGE.md)

2. **EXTRACT & DELETE documentation files**:
   - `AI-CONTEXT.md`:
     - Extract "Document Hierarchy" → `standards.md` new section "Context Loading Strategy"
     - Extract "Pattern Loading Triggers" → `principles.md` enhancement
     - Git hooks warning already in standards.md (no action needed)
     - Discard: Future vision content (exploratory, not actionable)

   - `CONTEXT-SCALING.md`:
     - Extract "Current context sizes" → `principles.md` implementation note
     - Extract "Vectorization trigger points" → `decisions.md` as architectural decision
     - Discard: Detailed analysis (exploratory research, complete)

   - `DEVELOPMENT.md`:
     - Extract "PM scripts workflow" → root `CONTRIBUTING.md`
     - Extract "Dogfooding workflow" → root `CONTRIBUTING.md`
     - Extract "Debugging instructions" → root `CONTRIBUTING.md`
     - Redundant content overlaps existing CONTRIBUTING.md

3. **DELETE dead code**:
   - `project-meta.json` (loaded but never used in ConfigManager.getMergedConfig())

4. **MOVE misplaced files**:
   - `development-plan.json` → `.hodge/features/HODGE-346/plan.json`

5. **KEEP active files** (11 files):
   - Runtime state: HODGE.md, context.json, .session
   - Knowledge: standards.md, decisions.md, principles.md
   - Configuration: toolchain.yaml, review-config.md, review-tier-config.yaml
   - PM tracking: project_management.md, id-counter.json, id-mappings.json, .pm-queue.json

**Pros**:
- Achieves true DRY - single source of truth for all knowledge
- Reduces maintenance burden significantly (42% reduction: 19→11 files)
- Improves discoverability (content in expected locations)
- Clean separation: runtime files vs knowledge files vs config files
- No functional changes - only organizational

**Cons**:
- Requires careful content extraction to avoid losing valuable information
- Need to verify no slash commands reference deleted files
- Moderate effort for content migration
- Risk of missing edge-case references

**When to use**: When you want to eliminate technical debt and establish clear information architecture (our current situation).

### Approach 2: Archive and Preserve

**Description**: Keep all files but move outdated docs to `.hodge/archive/` directory for reference.

**Steps**:
1. Create `.hodge/archive/` directory
2. Move AI-CONTEXT.md, CONTEXT-SCALING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md to archive
3. Keep .claude/CLAUDE.md and project-meta.json (no deletions)
4. Add README.md to archive explaining why files preserved

**Pros**:
- No risk of losing information
- Easy to retrieve if needed later
- Zero breaking changes
- Quick to implement

**Cons**:
- Doesn't solve DRY problem (status redundancy remains)
- Still have unused files cluttering directory listings
- Adds complexity (archive directory to maintain)
- Defers cleanup decisions indefinitely
- Archive grows over time

**When to use**: When you're uncertain about content value and want to defer cleanup decisions.

### Approach 3: Hybrid - Keep Essential Redundancy

**Description**: Accept some duplication where it serves a purpose (e.g., `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code UX), consolidate the rest.

**Steps**:
1. Keep `.claude/CLAUDE.md` as "generated view" of HODGE.md
2. Update hodge-md-generator to also generate .claude/CLAUDE.md
3. Delete dead code (project-meta.json)
4. Extract and delete documentation files
5. Move development-plan.json

**Pros**:
- Pragmatic trade-off between DRY and tool integration
- Could provide optimized views for different tools
- Preserves tool-specific UX preferences

**Cons**:
- Partial solution - still have maintenance burden
- Need to maintain sync between HODGE.md and .claude/CLAUDE.md
- Adds generation complexity to hodge-md-generator
- Unclear if .claude/CLAUDE.md actually provides value (Claude Code reads .hodge/ fine)
- More code to maintain

**When to use**: When different tools have strong preferences for specific file locations and we have evidence they can't read .hodge/ files.

## Recommendation

**Use Approach 1: Surgical Cleanup with Content Extraction**

**Rationale**:
- User explicitly requested "single source of truth" (Q1: option a)
- Audit proved .claude/CLAUDE.md is NOT generated (manual duplicate)
- Audit proved project-meta.json is dead code (loaded but unused)
- Documentation files contain extractable content that belongs elsewhere
- No evidence that Claude Code requires .claude/CLAUDE.md (it reads .hodge/ files fine)
- 42% file reduction with zero functional impact

**Implementation Priority**:
1. High: Delete .claude/CLAUDE.md, project-meta.json (obvious redundancy/dead code)
2. Medium: Extract and delete documentation files (preserves knowledge)
3. Low: Move development-plan.json (organizational improvement)

## Test Intentions

### Behavioral Expectations:

1. **No Breaking Changes**:
   - Deleted files should not break any existing hodge commands
   - All test suites should pass unchanged
   - CLI functionality remains identical

2. **Content Preservation**:
   - Extracted content from AI-CONTEXT.md should be accessible in standards.md and principles.md
   - Extracted content from CONTEXT-SCALING.md should be accessible in decisions.md
   - Extracted content from DEVELOPMENT.md should be accessible in root CONTRIBUTING.md

3. **File Relocation**:
   - Moved development-plan.json should still be readable by `hodge plan` command
   - Plan command should check both old and new locations for backward compatibility

4. **Single Source of Truth**:
   - Status information should exist in exactly one place (HODGE.md)
   - No duplicate content between remaining files
   - grep for any lingering references to deleted files returns zero results

5. **Runtime State Intact**:
   - All actively-used runtime files remain: context.json, .session, HODGE.md
   - Session management continues working
   - Context management continues working

6. **Knowledge Accessible**:
   - All standards remain in standards.md
   - All decisions remain in decisions.md
   - All principles remain in principles.md
   - No information loss from documentation file consolidation

## Decisions Decided During Exploration

1. ✓ **Use Approach 1** (Surgical Cleanup with Content Extraction) - aligns with user's "single source of truth" requirement
2. ✓ **Delete .claude/CLAUDE.md** - it's a manual duplicate of .hodge/HODGE.md, not generated by CLI
3. ✓ **Delete project-meta.json** - it's dead code (ConfigManager loads it but never uses it)
4. ✓ **Extract valuable content before deletion** - migrate content to standards.md, principles.md, decisions.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
5. ✓ **Move development-plan.json** to `.hodge/features/HODGE-346/plan.json` - feature-specific file belongs in feature directory

## No Decisions Needed

All decisions were resolved during exploration through codebase audit and user clarification.
