**Reviewed**: 2025-10-08T18:10:00.000Z
**Scope**: Feature changes (8 files)
**Profiles Used**: general-coding-standards, general-test-standards, typescript-5.x

## Summary
- üö´ **0 Blockers** (must fix before proceeding)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **3 Warnings** (should address before ship)
- üí° **0 Suggestions** (optional improvements)

## Critical Issues (BLOCKER)
None found.

## Warnings

### src/bin/hodge.ts:7-8
**Violation**: Naming Convention - WARNING
Variables `__filename` and `__dirname` use double underscore prefix which violates ESLint naming-convention rule. However, these are standard Node.js CommonJS patterns required for ES modules compatibility.

**Recommendation**: This is acceptable for ES module compatibility patterns. Can be addressed with ESLint ignore comments if desired.

### src/bin/hodge.ts:94
**Violation**: Nullish Coalescing - WARNING
Using logical OR (`||`) instead of nullish coalescing operator (`??`). The `??` operator is safer as it only checks for null/undefined, not other falsy values.

**Recommendation**: Low priority - current code works correctly. Consider updating to `??` for consistency.

### .claude/commands/harden.md
**Violation**: Documentation Enhancement - WARNING
Added Step 5 for review report generation. This new documentation should be tested to ensure AI can successfully follow the instructions and generate properly formatted reports.

**Recommendation**: Validate through actual usage (this session serves as validation).

## Suggestions
None found.
