  "commitMessage": "feat: complete profile composition system and harden integration (HODGE-333.4)\n\n## What Changed\n\n**New Infrastructure** (2 files, 15.4KB):\n- src/lib/profile-composition-service.ts: Core service for composing review context\n  - Loads profiles from .hodge/review-config.md with fallback to defaults\n  - Concatenates project context (standards, principles, decisions, patterns)\n  - Implements precedence rules (project context > reusable profiles)\n  - Handles missing files gracefully (warn for profiles, fail for project files)\n- src/lib/profile-composition-service.smoke.test.ts: 5 smoke tests (all passing)\n\n**Command Updates** (3 files, +324/-183 lines):\n- src/commands/review.ts: Multi-scope review support\n  - Implemented /review file, /review directory, /review recent --last N\n  - Recursive directory scanning with .gitignore filtering\n  - Git diff integration for recent commits scope\n  - File type filtering (ts, js, tsx, jsx, py, java, kt, go, rs)\n- src/commands/harden.ts: Review integration\n  - Added --review flag for AI code review context loading\n  - Implemented handleReviewMode() with ProfileCompositionService\n  - Gets changed files via git diff HEAD\n  - Saves review-context.md and changed-files.txt to harden directory\n- src/bin/hodge.ts: CLI registration for review command with options\n\n**Test Updates** (3 files, +24/-24 lines):\n- src/commands/review.integration.test.ts: Fixed 3 integration tests\n  - Updated expectations for new ProfileCompositionService output format\n  - Changed from \"**Standards Loaded**\" to \"**Profiles Loaded**\"\n  - Tests now validate composition behavior correctly\n- src/commands/review.smoke.test.ts: Updated 2 smoke tests\n  - Fixed assertions for new command output\n- src/test/standards-enforcement.smoke.test.ts: Updated harden.md validation\n  - Changed from \"Pre-Harden Standards Review\" to \"Pre-Harden Code Review\"\n  - Updated for new template structure with review report generation\n\n**Template Enhancement** (1 file, +146/-61 lines):\n- .claude/commands/harden.md: Added Step 5 for review-report.md generation\n  - AI now generates review-report.md documenting findings\n  - Includes format with Blocker/Warning/Suggestion categories\n  - Example templates for clean and issues-found scenarios\n- src/lib/claude-commands.ts: Auto-synced from harden.md changes\n\n**Metadata Updates** (7 files):\n- .hodge/.session, HODGE.md, context.json, features/HODGE-333/plan.json\n- id-mappings.json, project_management.md\n\n## Why This Change\n\nAfter HODGE-333.1-333.3 shipped the review profile infrastructure (frontmatter format, auto-detection, 39 profiles), the system needed:\n1. **Composition layer** to load and combine multiple profiles with project context\n2. **/harden integration** to run automated AI code reviews before validation tests\n3. **Expanded scopes** to review directories and recent commits, not just single files\n4. **Review reports** to document AI findings persistently\n\nThis completes the HODGE-333 epic vision: a unified markdown profile architecture that auto-detects technologies, ships with rich profiles, and integrates into the development workflow.\n\n## Impact\n\n✅ **Developer Experience**:\n- /review command now supports file, directory, and recent scopes\n- /harden runs AI code review before tests (catches issues earlier)\n- Review reports persist findings for future reference\n- Composition system loads all relevant profiles automatically\n\n✅ **Code Quality**:\n- 18 total tests (5 composition smoke + 8 review smoke + 5 review integration)\n- All 913 tests passing (41 skipped)\n- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality\n- ProfileCompositionService follows SRP (separated from ContextAggregator)\n\n✅ **Architecture**:\n- CLI discovers files and prepares context (structure)\n- AI reads content and generates reports (interpretation)\n- Maintains clean separation: CLI = orchestration, AI = content generation\n- Review-report.md written by AI using Write tool (slash command file creation pattern)\n\n✅ **Feature Completion**:\n- Phase 1: ProfileCompositionService ✅\n- Phase 2: Update /review command ✅\n- Phase 3: /harden integration with review reports ✅\n- Phase 4: Expanded review scopes ✅\n\n**Pattern**: Markdown profiles with YAML frontmatter + composition layer + integrated workflow = complete AI code review system.\n\nCloses HODGE-333.4"
