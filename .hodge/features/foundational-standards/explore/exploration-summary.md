# Foundational Standards Exploration

## Context
Since Hodge is starting fresh with no existing code patterns to learn from, we need to establish foundational standards for our own development. This exploration examines how to set up standards that align with Hodge's philosophy.

## Approach 1: Explicit Standards First
- **Implementation**: Define comprehensive standards upfront
- **Pros**: Clear expectations, consistency, easy enforcement
- **Cons**: May be rigid, needs updates over time
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing linting tools

## Approach 2: Emergent Standards  
- **Implementation**: Start minimal, let standards emerge from code
- **Pros**: Natural fit, team buy-in, adaptive
- **Cons**: Early inconsistency, takes time to stabilize
- **Compatibility**: Requires pattern detection system

## Approach 3: Hybrid Progressive Standards
- **Implementation**: Essential standards + progressive layers + learned patterns
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, dogfoods Hodge philosophy, mode-appropriate
- **Cons**: More complex implementation
- **Compatibility**: Perfect fit for three-mode system

## Recommendation

**Go with Approach 3: Hybrid Progressive Standards**

### Reasoning
1. **Dogfoods Hodge's philosophy** - We use our own three-mode progression
2. **Immediate safety** - Essential standards prevent critical mistakes
3. **Room to evolve** - Can learn and adapt as we build
4. **Mode-appropriate** - Standards enforcement matches current mode
5. **Practical** - Balances structure with flexibility

### Immediate Implementation Plan

Create `.hodge/standards.md` with three layers:

1. **Essential (Enforced Always)**
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - No `any` without justification  
   - Semantic commits
   - Tests for public APIs

2. **Recommended (Progressive)**
   - Error handling patterns
   - File organization
   - Documentation standards
   - 80% test coverage

3. **Learned (Future)**
   - Space for patterns we discover
   - Promoted based on usage
   - Team-specific conventions

### Next Steps
To implement these standards: `/build foundational-standards`

This will create the actual standards.md file and basic enforcement mechanism.
