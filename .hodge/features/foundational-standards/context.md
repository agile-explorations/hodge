# Foundational Standards - Build Context

## Chosen Approach
Implemented **Hybrid Progressive Standards** based on exploration.

## Implementation Details

### Created Files
1. **`.hodge/standards.md`** - Main standards documentation
   - Essential standards (always enforced)
   - Recommended standards (progressive enforcement)
   - Learned patterns section (for future discoveries)

2. **`.eslintrc.json`** - ESLint configuration
   - Enforces essential TypeScript standards
   - Warns on recommended patterns
   - Configured for TypeScript strict checking

3. **`.prettierrc.json`** - Code formatting rules
   - Consistent code style
   - 100 char line width
   - Single quotes, semicolons

4. **`.hodge/patterns/`** - Pattern library structure
   - README for pattern documentation
   - Ready for pattern extraction

## Key Decisions
- Three-tier standard system: Essential → Recommended → Learned
- Progressive enforcement based on mode (explore/build/harden)
- ESLint for code quality, Prettier for formatting
- Patterns directory for discovered code patterns

## Standards Philosophy
- Start with safety (essential standards)
- Allow flexibility in explore mode
- Progressively enforce in build/harden modes
- Learn from actual code patterns

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run lint` to check current code
2. Run `npm run format` to apply Prettier
3. Add pre-commit hooks (future)
4. Extract first patterns after more code is written
