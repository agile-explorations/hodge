# Test Intentions for Skipped Test Cleanup

## What We Will Test
- [ ] All behavioral tests still pass after cleanup
- [ ] Test count is correct after deletion
- [ ] No broken imports after removing test files
- [ ] Build process still works
- [ ] Coverage metrics still generated

## What We Won't Test
- [ ] The deletion process itself (it's a one-time operation)
- [ ] Historical test patterns (they're being removed)

## Validation Approach
- Run full test suite before deletion
- Run full test suite after deletion
- Compare coverage reports
- Ensure no regression in functionality

## Success Criteria
- 100% of remaining tests pass
- No broken references
- Cleaner, more focused test suite
- Clear documentation of what was removed and why
