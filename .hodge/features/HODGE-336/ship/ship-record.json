  "commitMessage": "feat: completely remove /load and /save commands (HODGE-336)\n\n## What Changed\n\n**Deleted Infrastructure** (17 files, ~3,950 lines removed):\n- Slash commands: .claude/commands/save.md, .claude/commands/load.md\n- CLI commands: src/commands/save.ts, src/commands/load.ts\n- Core services: src/lib/save-manager.ts (449 lines), src/lib/auto-save.ts (239 lines)\n- Type definitions: src/types/save-manifest.ts\n- Test files: 7 test files removed (save.test.ts, load.test.ts, save-load integration tests, auto-save tests, save-manager tests)\n- Skipped mock-heavy tests: 4 additional test files cleaned up\n\n**Modified Files** (8 files, -42/+42 lines net):\n- src/bin/hodge.ts: Removed save/load CLI command registration\n- Workflow commands (explore.ts, build.ts, harden.ts, ship.ts): Removed auto-save calls\n- src/lib/context-manager.ts: Removed loadSession() and loadRecent() methods (101 lines)\n- .claude/commands/hodge.md: Removed --list and --recent flags, updated session guidance\n- src/lib/claude-commands.ts: Auto-synced from template changes\n- src/test/test-isolation.smoke.test.ts: Removed reference to deleted auto-save.test.ts\n- test/commands/hodge-context-loading.test.ts: Updated for new template structure\n- scripts/create-test-workspace.test.ts: Removed 3 skipped mock-heavy tests\n\n**Metadata Updates** (5 files):\n- .hodge/.session, context.json, id-mappings.json, id-counter.json, project_management.md\n\n## Why This Change\n\nThe /save and /load commands duplicated functionality now better served by /hodge HODGE-XXX:\n\n1. **Feature Simplification**: /hodge loads feature context directly, making save/load unnecessary\n2. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed ~3,950 lines of unused session management code\n3. **Better UX**: /hodge HODGE-XXX is more intuitive than save/load workflow\n4. **Maintenance Burden**: Auto-save created 896 directories that were never used\n5. **Code Quality**: Removed mock-heavy unit tests, aligning with \"test behavior not implementation\" principle\n\n## Impact\n\nâœ… **Developer Experience**:\n- Simpler workflow: /hodge HODGE-XXX replaces /save + /load\n- Fewer commands to learn (reduced from 9 to 7 main commands)\n- No more auto-save noise or directory clutter\n\nâœ… **Codebase Health**:\n- 3,950 lines removed (net -3,907 lines after updates)\n- 17 files deleted\n- Zero regressions: 876/876 tests passing\n- Improved test quality (removed mock-heavy tests)\n\nâœ… **Architecture**:\n- Cleaner separation: ContextManager focused on workflow state only\n- No orphaned references (verified via grep)\n- Logging standards maintained (HODGE-330)\n- CLI architecture standards maintained (HODGE-321)\n\n**Pattern**: When a feature becomes redundant, complete removal is better than deprecation. Clean deletions prevent maintenance burden and reduce cognitive load.\n\nCloses HODGE-336\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
