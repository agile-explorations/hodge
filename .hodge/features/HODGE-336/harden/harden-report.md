10/8/2025, 8:37:53 PM INFO  [Explore] 🔍 Exploring Topic: Optimize the review process during harden phase. The current template asks for 60-100K tokens of review context (standards, principles, decisions, patterns, review profiles) which creates cognitive load and unclear value proposition. Need to make review more practical while maintaining quality.

Key issues:
1. Template complexity - loads massive context that may not all be relevant
2. Unclear value proposition - what does review catch that validation doesn't?
3. Review is confirmatory not corrective for low-risk changes (deletions)
4. Need balance between thoroughness and practicality

Potential solutions to explore:
- Chunked context (load only relevant sections)
- Risk-based review depth (deletions vs new code)
- Clarified review purpose (architectural assessment vs correctness)
- Useful review reports (document findings persistently)

Context: During HODGE-336 harden, the pre-harden review was initially skipped due to pattern matching and cognitive shortcuts. Full retrospective review was completed but raised questions about template design.

10/8/2025, 8:38:07 PM INFO  [Explore] 🔍 Exploring Topic: Fix auto-detection for review profiles to check version ranges. Currently auto-detection detects ALL profiles that mention a dependency (e.g., all TypeScript profiles, all Vitest profiles) rather than selecting the best match based on actual installed version.

Issues:
1. version_range field in detection rules is defined but never used by AutoDetectionService
2. Over-inclusive detection - detects typescript-4.x, typescript-5.x, vitest-0.34+, vitest-1.x when only one of each should match
3. No version checking logic - just checks if dependency exists in package.json
4. Results in bloated review-config.md with redundant profiles

Expected behavior:
- Parse version_range field from profile frontmatter (e.g., '>=5.0.0 <6.0.0')
- Read actual installed version from package.json dependencies/devDependencies
- Use semver comparison to select only matching profiles
- For multiple matches, select the most specific version range

Example: Project has typescript@5.3.3, should detect only typescript-5.x.md, not typescript-4.x.md

Files involved:
- src/lib/auto-detection-service.ts (evaluateDetectionRules method)
- src/lib/frontmatter-parser.ts (DetectionRules interface has version_range field)
- review-profiles/languages/typescript-*.md (have version_range in frontmatter)

10/8/2025, 8:38:20 PM INFO  [Explore] 🔍 Exploring Topic: Create Vitest 3.x review profile. Current profiles cover Vitest 0.34+ and 1.x, but Hodge project uses Vitest 3.2.4 which has different APIs and features.

Vitest 3.x changes to cover:
- Updated test API (expect, describe, it remain similar but some matchers changed)
- Workspace support improvements
- Browser mode enhancements
- Coverage improvements (v8 and istanbul)
- Snapshot testing updates
- Performance optimizations
- Breaking changes from 1.x to 3.x

Structure:
- Follow existing profile format (review-profiles/testing/vitest-1.x.md as template)
- Add frontmatter with detection rules (vitest dependency, version_range: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')
- Include best practices for Vitest 3.x specific features
- Enforcement levels: MANDATORY for critical issues, WARNING for recommendations
- Keep aligned with general-test-standards.md philosophy (behavior over implementation)

Files to reference:
- review-profiles/testing/vitest-1.x.md (template structure)
- review-profiles/testing/vitest-0.34+.md (earlier version reference)
- review-profiles/testing/general-test-standards.md (universal testing principles)

Note: This profile will be used by Hodge framework itself and other projects using Vitest 3.x

10/8/2025, 8:37:53 PM INFO  [Explore] 🔍 Exploring Topic: Optimize the review process during harden phase. The current template asks for 60-100K tokens of review context (standards, principles, decisions, patterns, review profiles) which creates cognitive load and unclear value proposition. Need to make review more practical while maintaining quality.

Key issues:
1. Template complexity - loads massive context that may not all be relevant
2. Unclear value proposition - what does review catch that validation doesn't?
3. Review is confirmatory not corrective for low-risk changes (deletions)
4. Need balance between thoroughness and practicality

Potential solutions to explore:
- Chunked context (load only relevant sections)
- Risk-based review depth (deletions vs new code)
- Clarified review purpose (architectural assessment vs correctness)
- Useful review reports (document findings persistently)

Context: During HODGE-336 harden, the pre-harden review was initially skipped due to pattern matching and cognitive shortcuts. Full retrospective review was completed but raised questions about template design.

10/8/2025, 8:38:07 PM INFO  [Explore] 🔍 Exploring Topic: Fix auto-detection for review profiles to check version ranges. Currently auto-detection detects ALL profiles that mention a dependency (e.g., all TypeScript profiles, all Vitest profiles) rather than selecting the best match based on actual installed version.

Issues:
1. version_range field in detection rules is defined but never used by AutoDetectionService
2. Over-inclusive detection - detects typescript-4.x, typescript-5.x, vitest-0.34+, vitest-1.x when only one of each should match
3. No version checking logic - just checks if dependency exists in package.json
4. Results in bloated review-config.md with redundant profiles

Expected behavior:
- Parse version_range field from profile frontmatter (e.g., '>=5.0.0 <6.0.0')
- Read actual installed version from package.json dependencies/devDependencies
- Use semver comparison to select only matching profiles
- For multiple matches, select the most specific version range

Example: Project has typescript@5.3.3, should detect only typescript-5.x.md, not typescript-4.x.md

Files involved:
- src/lib/auto-detection-service.ts (evaluateDetectionRules method)
- src/lib/frontmatter-parser.ts (DetectionRules interface has version_range field)
- review-profiles/languages/typescript-*.md (have version_range in frontmatter)

10/8/2025, 8:38:20 PM INFO  [Explore] 🔍 Exploring Topic: Create Vitest 3.x review profile. Current profiles cover Vitest 0.34+ and 1.x, but Hodge project uses Vitest 3.2.4 which has different APIs and features.

Vitest 3.x changes to cover:
- Updated test API (expect, describe, it remain similar but some matchers changed)
- Workspace support improvements
- Browser mode enhancements
- Coverage improvements (v8 and istanbul)
- Snapshot testing updates
- Performance optimizations
- Breaking changes from 1.x to 3.x

Structure:
- Follow existing profile format (review-profiles/testing/vitest-1.x.md as template)
- Add frontmatter with detection rules (vitest dependency, version_range: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')
- Include best practices for Vitest 3.x specific features
- Enforcement levels: MANDATORY for critical issues, WARNING for recommendations
- Keep aligned with general-test-standards.md philosophy (behavior over implementation)

Files to reference:
- review-profiles/testing/vitest-1.x.md (template structure)
- review-profiles/testing/vitest-0.34+.md (earlier version reference)
- review-profiles/testing/general-test-standards.md (universal testing principles)

Note: This profile will be used by Hodge framework itself and other projects using Vitest 3.x

10/8/2025, 8:37:53 PM INFO  [Explore] 🔍 Exploring Topic: Optimize the review process during harden phase. The current template asks for 60-100K tokens of review context (standards, principles, decisions, patterns, review profiles) which creates cognitive load and unclear value proposition. Need to make review more practical while maintaining quality.

Key issues:
1. Template complexity - loads massive context that may not all be relevant
2. Unclear value proposition - what does review catch that validation doesn't?
3. Review is confirmatory not corrective for low-risk changes (deletions)
4. Need balance between thoroughness and practicality

Potential solutions to explore:
- Chunked context (load only relevant sections)
- Risk-based review depth (deletions vs new code)
- Clarified review purpose (architectural assessment vs correctness)
- Useful review reports (document findings persistently)

Context: During HODGE-336 harden, the pre-harden review was initially skipped due to pattern matching and cognitive shortcuts. Full retrospective review was completed but raised questions about template design.

10/8/2025, 8:38:07 PM INFO  [Explore] 🔍 Exploring Topic: Fix auto-detection for review profiles to check version ranges. Currently auto-detection detects ALL profiles that mention a dependency (e.g., all TypeScript profiles, all Vitest profiles) rather than selecting the best match based on actual installed version.

Issues:
1. version_range field in detection rules is defined but never used by AutoDetectionService
2. Over-inclusive detection - detects typescript-4.x, typescript-5.x, vitest-0.34+, vitest-1.x when only one of each should match
3. No version checking logic - just checks if dependency exists in package.json
4. Results in bloated review-config.md with redundant profiles

Expected behavior:
- Parse version_range field from profile frontmatter (e.g., '>=5.0.0 <6.0.0')
- Read actual installed version from package.json dependencies/devDependencies
- Use semver comparison to select only matching profiles
- For multiple matches, select the most specific version range

Example: Project has typescript@5.3.3, should detect only typescript-5.x.md, not typescript-4.x.md

Files involved:
- src/lib/auto-detection-service.ts (evaluateDetectionRules method)
- src/lib/frontmatter-parser.ts (DetectionRules interface has version_range field)
- review-profiles/languages/typescript-*.md (have version_range in frontmatter)

Vitest 3.x changes to cover:
- Updated test API (expect, describe, it remain similar but some matchers changed)
- Workspace support improvements
- Browser mode enhancements
- Coverage improvements (v8 and istanbul)
- Snapshot testing updates
- Performance optimizations
- Breaking changes from 1.x to 3.x

Structure:
- Follow existing profile format (review-profiles/testing/vitest-1.x.md as template)
- Add frontmatter with detection rules (vitest dependency, version_range: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0')
- Include best practices for Vitest 3.x specific features
- Enforcement levels: MANDATORY for critical issues, WARNING for recommendations
- Keep aligned with general-test-standards.md philosophy (behavior over implementation)

Files to reference:
- review-profiles/testing/vitest-1.x.md (template structure)
- review-profiles/testing/vitest-0.34+.md (earlier version reference)
- review-profiles/testing/general-test-standards.md (universal testing principles)

Note: This profile will be used by Hodge framework itself and other projects using Vitest 3.x
