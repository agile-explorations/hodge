# Linked Decisions for auth-system

## Origin
This feature was extracted from the following decisions:

1. Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication
2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
3. Add refresh token rotation for security

## Context
These decisions were made during the exploration and design phase and form the foundation for this feature's implementation.
