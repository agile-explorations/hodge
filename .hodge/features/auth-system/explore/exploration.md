# auth-system Exploration

## Feature Overview
**Description**: JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control
**Estimated Effort**: 3 days

## Origin
This feature was extracted from the following decisions:
- Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Add refresh token rotation for security

## Why This Is a Coherent Feature
These three decisions all relate to the authentication and authorization layer.
They form a coherent unit because:
- JWT provides the authentication mechanism
- RBAC provides the authorization framework
- Refresh tokens enhance the security of the JWT implementation
Together they create a complete auth solution.



## Scope
### Included
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role and permission models
- Refresh token rotation logic
- Middleware for route protection

### Excluded
- User registration flow
- Password reset functionality
- OAuth/SSO integration

## Dependencies
- jsonwebtoken library
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Redis for token blacklisting

## Exploration Areas
### Token Strategy
- What should be the JWT expiration time?
- Should we use symmetric or asymmetric signing?
- How to handle token revocation?

### RBAC Design
- Should roles be hierarchical or flat?
- How granular should permissions be?
- Dynamic vs static role assignment?

### Security Considerations
- How to detect and prevent token replay attacks?
- Should we implement rate limiting?
- How to handle concurrent refresh token requests?

## Next Steps
1. Complete exploration of identified areas
2. Make architectural decisions based on findings
3. Update test intentions with specific scenarios
4. Proceed to build phase with chosen approach
