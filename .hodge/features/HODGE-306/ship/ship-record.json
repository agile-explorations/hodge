  "commitMessage": "feat: add PM issue creation prompt to /build command (HODGE-306)\n\n## What Changed\n- Enhanced .claude/commands/build.md (39 lines added)\n  - Added PM issue check section before Command Execution\n  - Prompts AI to check id-mappings.json for feature tracking\n  - Guides user to create PM issue via /plan if unmapped\n  - Non-blocking behavior (proceeds anyway if declined)\n  \n- Created .claude/commands/build.smoke.test.ts (NEW)\n  - 5 smoke tests verifying template changes\n  - Tests PM check section, user prompts, /plan integration\n  - Tests non-blocking behavior and skip logic\n  \n- Auto-synced src/lib/claude-commands.ts (39 lines)\n  - Synchronized slash command definitions with build.md changes\n  \n- Updated .hodge metadata files\n  - Recorded 5 implementation decisions for HODGE-306\n  - Created feature tracking in .hodge/features/HODGE-306/\n  - Updated session, context, and PM tracking\n\n## Why This Change\nThe /build command previously had no way to prompt users to create PM \nissue tracking for features. Users would often start building without \nPM tracking, making it harder to coordinate work and track progress.\n\nThis implements a template-based prompt that:\n- Checks if feature has PM mapping before building\n- Offers to create single-issue plan if unmapped\n- Respects \"freedom to explore\" (non-blocking)\n- Uses AI-driven approach (no CLI code changes)\n\n## Impact\n- ✅ Users prompted to create PM tracking when beneficial\n- ✅ Zero code changes (pure template documentation)\n- ✅ Non-blocking workflow (respects user agency)\n- ✅ Reuses /plan command for single-issue creation\n- ✅ All 611 tests passing (5 new smoke tests)\n- ✅ Production-ready (passed harden validation)\n\nCloses HODGE-306"
