  "commitMessage": "fix: enhance PM issue description extraction from exploration and decisions (HODGE-313)\n\n## What Changed\n- **/explore template** (.claude/commands/explore.md: 17 lines modified)\n  - Added Title field generation instruction for AI\n  - New step 2: Generate concise title (<100 chars) for PM issue creation\n  - Updated step numbering from 2-7 to 3-8\n\n- **Plan Command** (src/commands/plan.ts: 105 lines modified)\n  - Enhanced getFeatureDescription() with 5-priority extraction strategy:\n    1. **Title** field from exploration.md (AI-generated)\n    2. ## Problem Statement heading format\n    3. **Problem Statement:** inline format  \n    4. Type field\n    5. Feature Overview section\n  - Added decision fallback extraction (implement/approach/use keywords)\n  - New cleanDecisionText() helper removes phase markers\n  - New truncateDescription() helper with word boundary at 100 chars\n\n- **PM Hooks** (src/lib/pm/pm-hooks.ts: 62 lines modified)\n  - Updated formatDecisionsForPM() to include problem statement before decisions\n  - New extractProblemStatement() method for exploration.md parsing\n  - Problem statement now appears above \"Decisions Made\" in PM issue body\n\n- **Test Coverage** (src/commands/plan.smoke.test.ts: 122 lines added)\n  - Added 5 smoke tests for description extraction\n  - Tests Title field extraction\n  - Tests ## Problem Statement heading extraction  \n  - Tests truncation at 100 chars with word boundary\n  - Tests decision fallback when no exploration exists\n  - Tests \"No description available\" fallback\n  - All 5 tests passing\n\n- **Slash Commands** (src/lib/claude-commands.ts: 17 lines auto-synced)\n  - Synchronized explore.md template changes\n\n## Why This Change\nPM issues created via `/build` after `/decide` (without `/plan`) showed \"HODGE-XXX: No description available\" with no context in the issue body. Root cause: getFeatureDescription() only checked for one specific format and returned fallback text when exploration.md didn't exist.\n\nThe fix leverages AI to generate semantic titles during exploration (AI is better at concise summarization), then CLI extracts that structured data. This aligns with Hodge's architecture: \"AI analyzes, backend executes.\"\n\n## Impact\n- âœ… PM issues now have meaningful titles from AI-generated Title field\n- âœ… Backward compatible: existing exploration.md files work with new regex patterns\n- âœ… Problem statement provides context before decisions in issue body\n- âœ… Decision fallback works when users skip `/explore` entirely  \n- âœ… All 635 tests passing (5 new smoke tests, 2 pre-existing flaky tests unrelated to this change)\n- âœ… Zero breaking changes\n\nCloses HODGE-313\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
