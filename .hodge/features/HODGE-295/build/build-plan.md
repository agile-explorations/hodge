# Build Plan: HODGE-295

## Feature Overview
**PM Issue**: HODGE-295 (linear)
**Status**: In Progress

## Implementation Checklist

### Core Implementation
- [x] Create pre-push hook script
- [x] Implement smart selective checks logic
- [x] Add npm audit caching mechanism
- [x] Include performance monitoring

### Integration
- [x] Integrate with existing husky setup
- [x] Configure prettier for all files check
- [x] Set up cache directory structure

### Quality Checks
- [x] Follow bash scripting best practices
- [x] Use color output for better UX
- [x] Add helpful error messages
- [x] Consider edge cases (offline, cache invalidation)

## Files Modified
<!-- Track files as you modify them -->
- `.husky/pre-push` - New pre-push hook with smart selective checks
- `test/pre-push-hook.test.ts` - Smoke tests for hook functionality
- `docs/pre-push-hooks.md` - Documentation for the pre-push quality checks feature

## Decisions Made
<!-- Document any implementation decisions -->
- Used bash instead of Node.js for performance and portability
- Cache stored in `.hodge/.cache/` to keep it organized
- Branch detection uses git stdin parsing for accuracy
- Colors added for better developer experience
- Performance timing included to track 5-second threshold

## Testing Notes
<!-- Notes for testing approach -->
- Test scenario 1
- Test scenario 2

## Next Steps
After implementation:
1. Run tests with `npm test`
2. Check linting with `npm run lint`
3. Review changes
4. Proceed to `/harden HODGE-295` for production readiness
