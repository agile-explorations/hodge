# Test Intentions for HODGE-295

## Purpose
Document what we intend to test when this feature moves to build mode.
These are not actual tests, but a checklist of behaviors to verify.

## Core Requirements
- [ ] Pre-push hook should execute before git push operations
- [ ] Should complete within 5 seconds for typical operations
- [ ] Should provide clear feedback about which checks are running
- [ ] Should integrate with existing husky setup without conflicts

## Quality Check Requirements
- [ ] Should run prettier check on all files when configured
- [ ] Should run npm audit with appropriate audit level
- [ ] Should detect and report formatting issues before push
- [ ] Should detect and report security vulnerabilities before push

## Branch-Specific Behavior
- [ ] Should run full checks when pushing to main/develop branches
- [ ] Should allow quick pushes to feature branches (with smart checks)
- [ ] Should detect target branch correctly from git push arguments
- [ ] Should handle force pushes appropriately

## Caching and Performance
- [ ] Should cache npm audit results when unchanged dependencies
- [ ] Should invalidate cache when package-lock.json changes
- [ ] Should skip expensive checks when appropriate
- [ ] Should provide option to force all checks

## Error Handling
- [ ] Should handle network failures gracefully (npm audit offline)
- [ ] Should provide actionable error messages
- [ ] Should allow bypass with explicit flag in emergencies
- [ ] Should not corrupt git state on failure

## Developer Experience
- [ ] Should show progress for long-running operations
- [ ] Should explain why push was blocked when checks fail
- [ ] Should provide commands to fix issues automatically when possible
- [ ] Should respect --no-verify flag based on team decision

## Integration Tests
- [ ] Should work with existing lint-staged setup
- [ ] Should not interfere with pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Should work across different git configurations
- [ ] Should handle multiple remote repositories correctly

## Notes
Add any specific test scenarios or edge cases discovered during exploration:

- Test with large repositories (performance impact)
- Test with outdated dependencies (audit failures)
- Test with unformatted files in different locations
- Test behavior when pushing tags vs branches
- Test with different git push variations (tracking, upstream, etc.)
