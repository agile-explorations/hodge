# Test Intentions for HODGE-285 - Fix Explore Multiple Options

## Purpose
Ensure the explore command generates and presents 2-3 implementation approaches instead of just 1.

## Core Requirements
- [ ] `hodge explore` should generate 2-3 approaches (not just 1)
- [ ] Each approach should have distinct characteristics
- [ ] CLI output should say "Consider the 2-3 suggested approaches"
- [ ] Exploration.md should contain all generated approaches

## Approach Generation Tests
- [ ] Should generate exactly 2-3 approaches for any feature
- [ ] Each approach should have a unique name
- [ ] Each approach should have different pros/cons
- [ ] Approaches should represent different paradigms (standard, optimized, experimental)

## CLI Output Tests
- [ ] CLI should display "Recommended Approaches" (plural)
- [ ] Should show count correctly: "Consider the 3 suggested approaches"
- [ ] Should list all approach names in the output
- [ ] Should maintain the recommended approach designation

## File Generation Tests
- [ ] exploration.md should contain all 2-3 approaches
- [ ] Each approach should have complete documentation (description, pros, cons)
- [ ] The recommendation section should explain why one is preferred
- [ ] Decisions Needed section should list implementation approach choice

## Slash Command Integration Tests
- [ ] `/explore` should work with the multi-approach output
- [ ] The Next Steps menu should handle multiple approaches correctly
- [ ] `/decide` should be able to present all approaches as options
- [ ] `/build` should work with the recommended approach

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Should handle features with limited scope gracefully
- [ ] Should generate variety even for similar features
- [ ] Should not duplicate approaches
- [ ] Should handle feature names of any length

## Notes
Specific test scenarios discovered during exploration:

- Test with "explore-multiple-options-presentation" as feature name
- Verify the fix works for both HODGE-XXX and custom feature names
- Check that AI generation prompts produce variety
