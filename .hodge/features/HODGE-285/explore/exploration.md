# Exploration: HODGE-285 - Fix Explore Command Multiple Options

## Problem Statement
The `/explore` command is only presenting 1 implementation approach when it should be presenting 2-3 approaches for consideration. This reduces the exploration value and limits creative problem-solving.

## Root Cause Analysis
After analyzing the issue:
1. **CLI Auto-generation**: The `hodge explore` command only generates 1 approach automatically
2. **Template Instruction Gap**: The slash command says "Generate 2-3 approaches" but the CLI doesn't follow this
3. **Menu Limitation**: The Next Steps menu only shows one `/build` option with the recommended approach

## Recommended Approaches

### Approach 1: Enhanced CLI Generation (Recommended)
**Description**: Modify the explore command in the CLI to always generate 2-3 approaches using different strategies

**Implementation**:
- Update `src/commands/explore.ts` to generate multiple approaches
- Use different generation strategies (standard, optimized, experimental)
- Ensure AI exploration considers different paradigms

**Pros**:
- Fixes the root cause in the CLI
- Automatically provides variety
- Works for all future explorations
- Maintains consistency

**Cons**:
- Requires CLI code changes
- May need AI prompt engineering
- Could slow down exploration slightly

### Approach 2: Slash Command Template Override
**Description**: Update the explore.md template to explicitly generate additional approaches after CLI runs

**Implementation**:
- Add instructions to manually generate 2 more approaches
- Create a template section for additional approach generation
- Override whatever the CLI provides

**Pros**:
- No CLI changes needed
- Immediate fix available
- Full control over approach variety
- Can customize per feature type

**Cons**:
- Doesn't fix the underlying CLI issue
- Manual process each time
- Inconsistent with CLI output
- Creates disconnect between CLI and slash command

### Approach 3: Hybrid Progressive Enhancement
**Description**: Keep single-approach CLI but enhance the explore template to present multiple build paths

**Implementation**:
- Update Next Steps menu to show 3 build options with different approaches
- Use `/decide` more prominently for approach selection
- Generate approaches during the slash command execution

**Pros**:
- Works with current CLI behavior
- Emphasizes the decide phase
- Clear separation of concerns
- Progressive enhancement philosophy

**Cons**:
- Doesn't truly fix the exploration phase
- May confuse users about when approaches are generated
- Still shows "1 suggested approach" in CLI output

## Recommendation
**Approach 1: Enhanced CLI Generation** is recommended because:
- It fixes the root cause at the source
- Maintains consistency between CLI and slash commands
- Provides automatic variety without manual intervention
- Aligns with the original explore command intent


## Decisions Needed

### Implementation Approach
Which approach should we use to restore multiple options in explore?
- Enhanced CLI Generation (modify the CLI to generate 2-3 approaches)
- Slash Command Template Override (fix in slash command only)
- Hybrid Progressive Enhancement (keep single CLI, enhance menu)

### Scope Decisions
What's included in this fix?
- Just the explore command generation?
- Also update the Next Steps menu presentation?
- Include updates to both CLI and slash commands?

### Technical Choices
How should multiple approaches be generated?
- Use different AI prompts for variety?
- Apply different paradigms (standard, optimized, experimental)?
- Template-based approach generation?

### Testing Strategy
How do we verify the fix works?
- Manual testing of explore command
- Add tests to verify multiple approaches generated
- Check consistency between CLI and slash commands

## Implementation Hints
- Check `src/commands/explore.ts` for the AI generation logic
- Look for the `generateApproaches` or similar function
- Consider how the CLI currently limits to 1 approach
- Review the AI prompt that generates approaches

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review the 3 recommended approaches above
- [ ] Use `/decide` to choose implementation approach
- [ ] Proceed to `/build HODGE-285` with chosen approach
- [ ] Test that 2-3 approaches are generated
