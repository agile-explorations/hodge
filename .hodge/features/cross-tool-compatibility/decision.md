# Decision: Cross-Tool Compatibility

**Date**: 2025-01-16
**Status**: Decided - Ready to Build

## Chosen Approach
Start building cross-tool-compatibility immediately using the Hybrid approach with HODGE.md Primary + Tool-Specific Enhancements

## Rationale
- Foundation feature that enables everything else
- Already explored with three approaches evaluated
- Clear implementation path defined
- Aligns with previous architectural decisions

## Implementation Plan
1. Build HodgeMDGenerator class
2. Implement core HODGE.md sections
3. Add tool detection (optional Phase 2)
4. Create tool-specific enhancements (optional Phase 3)

## Next Step
Execute: `hodge build cross-tool-compatibility`
