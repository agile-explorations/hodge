# Exploration: Batch Decision Extraction

## Feature Overview
Extract and review multiple decisions from long exploration discussions, allowing batch processing of pending decisions.

## Context
- **Date**: 2025-01-16
- **User Note**: "Look carefully at how this will be different than what we're doing right now. What we're doing right now is working pretty well."
- **Decision Source**: See `.hodge/decisions.md` (2025-01-16 - "Implement batch decision extraction with careful design consideration")
- **Implementation Plan**: See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#phase-4-enhanced-features`

## Problem Statement
Long exploration sessions (like today's) generate many implicit decisions that need to be:
- Identified and extracted
- Reviewed for accuracy
- Recorded formally
- Linked to features

Current `/decide` interactive mode works well, but could be enhanced for better decision discovery.

## Current Behavior Analysis

### What Works Well Now
The current `/decide` command in interactive mode:
1. Manually identifies pending decisions
2. Presents them one by one
3. Waits for user input
4. Records chosen decisions

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Automated discovery** of decision points in conversation
2. **Bulk review** interface for efficiency
3. **Context preservation** from discussion
4. **Smart categorization** of decisions

## Approaches Explored

### Approach 1: Keep Current Manual System
Continue with current interactive mode only
- **Pros**: Works well, user has full control
- **Cons**: May miss decisions in long discussions

### Approach 2: Full AI Analysis
Use AI to analyze entire conversation for decisions
- **Pros**: Comprehensive, finds hidden decisions
- **Cons**: May over-extract, false positives, privacy concerns

### Approach 3: Hybrid Enhancement (RECOMMENDED)
Enhance current system with optional extraction
- **Pros**:
  - Keeps working manual mode
  - Adds discovery assistance
  - User reviews all suggestions
  - Can skip extraction if not needed
- **Cons**:
  - More complex than current system

## Recommended Approach: Careful Enhancement

### Design Principles
1. **Don't break what works** - Current interactive mode remains default
2. **Optional extraction** - User chooses when to use it
3. **Review required** - Never auto-record without review
4. **Context-aware** - Understands exploration vs general discussion

### Enhanced Command Flow
```bash
hodge decide --extract
# OR
hodge decide --from-discussion

# System scans for decisions, then shows:
```

### Extraction Interface
```
üìã Found 5 potential decisions from recent discussion:

1. ‚úÖ Use HODGE.md for cross-tool compatibility
   Context: Makes Hodge work with any AI tool
   Confidence: HIGH
   Source: Explicit agreement
   [Accept / Modify / Skip]

2. ü§î Implement session management in Phase 2
   Context: Allows context restoration between sessions
   Confidence: MEDIUM
   Source: Implied from discussion
   [Accept / Modify / Skip]

3. ‚ùì Use TypeScript for new features
   Context: Mentioned but not explicitly decided
   Confidence: LOW
   [Accept / Modify / Skip]

Review mode: [A]ccept all high confidence / [R]eview each / [C]ancel
```

### Decision Patterns to Detect
```typescript
const decisionIndicators = {
  explicit: [
    /we should/i,
    /let's go with/i,
    /the decision is/i,
    /we've decided/i
  ],
  implicit: [
    /the best approach/i,
    /this makes sense/i,
    /we'll implement/i
  ],
  questions: [
    /should we/i,
    /which approach/i,
    /do we need/i
  ]
};
```

### Comparison with Current Behavior

| Aspect | Current `/decide` | Enhanced `/decide --extract` |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Decision Discovery | Manual | Automated + Manual |
| Review Process | One by one | Batch or one by one |
| Context | User provides | Extracted from discussion |
| Speed | Slower for many | Faster for many |
| Control | Full | Full (nothing automatic) |
| Complexity | Simple | More complex |

## Test Intentions
- [ ] Extraction identifies real decisions
- [ ] False positive rate is low
- [ ] User can modify extracted decisions
- [ ] Batch accept/reject works
- [ ] Context is preserved correctly
- [ ] Original interactive mode still works
- [ ] Performance with long discussions

## Implementation Details

1. **DecisionExtractor Class**
   - Location: `src/lib/decision-extractor.ts`
   - Scans conversation/files for patterns
   - Ranks confidence levels
   - Preserves context

2. **Enhanced Decide Command**
   ```typescript
   class DecideCommand {
     async execute(decision?: string, options?: DecideOptions) {
       if (options.extract || options.fromDiscussion) {
         const extracted = await this.extractPendingDecisions();
         await this.presentBatchReview(extracted);
       } else {
         // Current behavior unchanged
         await this.interactiveMode(decision);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Key Decisions Made
1. ‚úÖ Implement with careful design consideration
2. ‚úÖ Keep current behavior as default
3. ‚úÖ Make extraction optional
4. ‚úÖ Require user review of all extracted decisions

## User Feedback Integration
Per user: "What we're doing right now is working pretty well"
- Current interactive mode remains unchanged
- Extraction is purely additive
- Can ignore extraction feature if not needed
- Focus on enhancing, not replacing

## Next Steps
1. Build after other features are stable
2. Start with simple pattern matching
3. Test with real exploration sessions
4. Iterate based on usage
5. Consider AI-assisted extraction later
