- ✅ Duplication: Minimal (1.53%)

## Warnings

### UX Pattern Compliance (15 violations)

After reviewing all 10 slash command files against the `claude-code-slash-commands.yaml` profile, I found the following UX pattern violations:

#### ⚠️ 1. Missing Response Parsing Section (review.md:1-10)
**Violation**: ai-parsing-guidance - MANDATORY/BLOCKER
**File**: `.claude/commands/review.md`
**Issue**: The `/review` command template is missing the "Response Parsing (AI Instructions)" section at the top that explains how to parse user responses to choice prompts. This section is MANDATORY per the profile.
**Recommendation**: Add the standard parsing section as seen in all other command files.

#### ⚠️ 2. Inconsistent Tip Formatting (Multiple Files)
**Violation**: modification-tip - MANDATORY/BLOCKER
**Files**: Multiple command files
**Issue**: Some files use "and also" while others use "and" in modification tips. The profile examples show "and also" for additive modifications.
**Recommendation**: Standardize to "💡 Tip: You can modify any choice, e.g., 'a, and also [modification]'"

#### ⚠️ 3. Missing Collaborative Error Recovery Examples (All Files)
**Violation**: collaborative-error-recovery - MANDATORY/WARNING
**Files**: All 10 command files
**Issue**: While the response parsing section mentions "collaborative error recovery" for invalid input, none of the templates actually show WHAT that looks like (no example of how to handle "maybe b?" or other uncertainty patterns).
**Recommendation**: Add error recovery guidance in the AI instructions section or reference a shared pattern.

#### ⚠️ 4. Inconsistent Use of "r" Shortcut (Multiple Files)
**Violation**: multi-recommendation-shortcut - MANDATORY/BLOCKER
**Files**: Several choice prompts across files
**Issue**: Some multi-recommendation choices show "or r for all recommended" in the prompt, while others only mention it in the response parsing section.
**Recommendation**: When 2+ options are marked ⭐, ALWAYS include "or r for all recommended" in the prompt line itself.

#### ⚠️ 5. Non-Standard Box Widths (explore.md, harden.md)
**Violation**: interaction-start-box - MANDATORY/BLOCKER
**Files**: `.claude/commands/explore.md`, `.claude/commands/harden.md`
**Issue**: The starting box pattern should be 60 characters wide for consistency. Some boxes appear to have different widths due to spacing.
**Recommendation**: Verify all boxes are exactly 60 characters wide (including box drawing characters).

#### ⚠️ 6. Missing "🔔 YOUR RESPONSE NEEDED" in Some Prompts (harden.md)
**Violation**: response-indicator-emoji - MANDATORY/BLOCKER
**File**: `.claude/commands/harden.md` (Step 6 assessment section)
**Issue**: Some choice prompts don't use the mandatory "🔔 YOUR RESPONSE NEEDED" indicator before presenting options.
**Recommendation**: Add the indicator to all choice prompts, even in numbered steps.

#### ⚠️ 7. Inconsistent "What's Next?" Section Format (Multiple Files)
**Violation**: bulleted-slash-commands - MANDATORY/BLOCKER
**Files**: Multiple command files
**Issue**: Some "What's Next?" sections use bullets (•), others use dashes (-). The profile mandates bullet character (•) for slash command suggestions.
**Recommendation**: Standardize all to bullet character (•).

#### ⚠️ 8. Missing Context-Aware Filtering Examples (status.md, hodge.md)
**Violation**: context-aware-filtering - SUGGESTED/WARNING
**Files**: `.claude/commands/status.md`, `.claude/commands/hodge.md`
**Issue**: These commands could benefit from more explicit smart filtering based on project state (e.g., don't show "/harden" if feature isn't built yet).
**Recommendation**: Add conditional logic to hide irrelevant commands based on feature state.

#### ⚠️ 9. Tone Inconsistency (Multiple Files)
**Violation**: knowledgeable-peer-tone - MANDATORY/WARNING
**Files**: Various sections across multiple files
**Issue**: Some sections use formal language ("System will process", "User must") instead of conversational pair-programming style ("Let me help", "Here's what we'll do").
**Recommendation**: Review all instructional text for tone consistency. Use first-person plural ("we", "let's") or first-person singular ("I notice", "let me").

#### ⚠️ 10. Missing Breadcrumbs in Multi-Step Commands (harden.md, ship.md)
**Violation**: hybrid-information-display - SUGGESTED/WARNING
**Files**: `.claude/commands/harden.md`, `.claude/commands/ship.md`
**Issue**: While these commands DO have step markers (Step 1 of 7, etc.), they could be improved with the recommended separator format from the profile.
**Recommendation**: Already partially implemented. Consider using the exact format from the profile:
```
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
📍 Step 1 of 7: [Step Name]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

#### ⚠️ 11-15. Pattern Consistency Gaps (Cross-Command)
**Violation**: pattern-consistency - MANDATORY/BLOCKER
**Issue**: While all commands follow MOST of the same patterns, there are minor inconsistencies in:
- How examples are formatted
- Where emojis are placed
- Spacing around sections
- Header capitalization

**Recommendation**: Do a final consistency pass across all 10 files to ensure identical formatting for identical elements.

### Duplication Warning (Non-Blocking)

**Issue**: The jscpd tool detected 1.53% exact clones across 11 files (61 duplicated lines).
**Assessment**: This is acceptable for documentation. Many slash commands share similar instructional text (response parsing, what's next sections), which aids consistency.
**Recommendation**: Keep as-is. The duplication supports consistency and user familiarity.

### Dependency-Cruiser Orphans (Non-Blocking)

**Issue**: All 10 `.md` files flagged as "orphans" (not imported by other files).
**Assessment**: This is expected and correct. Slash command templates are not imported - they're read directly by Claude Code.
**Recommendation**: No action needed. Consider adding a `.dependency-cruiser.js` exemption for `.claude/commands/*.md` if you want cleaner output.

### ESLint Ignored Files (Non-Blocking)

**Issue**: All 10 `.md` files ignored by default by ESLint.
**Assessment**: This is expected and correct. Markdown files don't need JavaScript linting.
**Recommendation**: No action needed.

### Semgrep Certificate Warning (Non-Blocking)

**Issue**: `[WARNING](ca-certs): Ignored 1 trust anchors`
**Assessment**: This is a certificate configuration warning, NOT a security finding in the code. Semgrep completed successfully with 0 findings.
**Recommendation**: This warning can be safely ignored. It relates to semgrep's certificate validation, not the scanned files. If it bothers you, it can be resolved by updating macOS certificates or semgrep configuration, but it doesn't affect functionality or security.

## Suggestions

### 1. Add Predictive Suggestions (context-aware-filtering)
**Enhancement**: Consider implementing the "Predictive Command Suggestions" pattern from the profile.
**Example**: In `/build` completion, suggest `/harden` if user consistently moves to harden after build.
**Benefit**: Reduces cognitive load, personalizes the experience.

### 2. Implement Pattern-Based Contextual Tips (contextual-tips)
**Enhancement**: When workflows match lessons from previous features, offer optional tips referencing specific feature IDs.
**Example**: "💡 Pattern from HODGE-351: Check for zombie processes when spawning subprocesses."
**Benefit**: Proactive learning from past mistakes.

### 3. Achievement and Progress Celebration (progress-celebration)
**Enhancement**: The `/ship` command has EXCELLENT celebration boxes based on velocity. Consider adding similar lightweight celebrations to other milestones (e.g., "/harden passing all checks").
**Benefit**: Positive reinforcement, makes the workflow more enjoyable.

## UX Pattern Compliance Summary

**Excellent Compliance** (8/14 patterns):
- ✅ interaction-start-box: All files have consistent opening boxes
- ✅ alphabetized-choice-lists: All choice prompts use a/b/c format
- ✅ recommendation-marking: ⭐ consistently marks recommended options
- ✅ modification-tip: Present in all choice prompts (minor formatting inconsistencies)
- ✅ ai-parsing-guidance: Present in 9/10 files (missing in review.md)
- ✅ response-indicator-emoji: Used consistently (with noted exceptions)
- ✅ bulleted-slash-commands: Mostly consistent (minor dash vs bullet issues)
- ✅ hybrid-information-display: Well-implemented in /harden and /ship

**Needs Attention** (6/14 patterns):
- ⚠️ multi-recommendation-shortcut: Inconsistently shown in prompts
- ⚠️ collaborative-error-recovery: Mentioned but not exemplified
- ⚠️ context-aware-filtering: Basic implementation, could be smarter
- ⚠️ knowledgeable-peer-tone: Mostly good, some formal language remains
- ⚠️ pattern-consistency: Minor inconsistencies across commands
- 💡 predictive-suggestions: Not implemented (SUGGESTED level)
- 💡 contextual-tips: Not implemented (SUGGESTED level)
- 💡 progress-celebration: Partial (/ship has it, others don't)

## Conclusion

### Overall Assessment

✅ **These slash command templates are excellent work.** They demonstrate:
- Deep commitment to consistent UX patterns
- Thoughtful conversational design
- Clear separation of concerns (AI vs CLI responsibilities)
- Progressive disclosure (step-by-step guidance)
- User agency (always offer choices, never force actions)

The UX pattern violations found are **mostly minor formatting inconsistencies** rather than fundamental design flaws. The core interaction patterns are solid.

### Production Readiness

🟡 **Conditionally ready** - Address BLOCKER-level UX pattern violations before shipping:
1. Add response parsing section to review.md
2. Standardize "r" shortcut display in multi-recommendation prompts
3. Fix tone inconsistencies (avoid formal "system will" language)
4. Standardize modification tip wording
5. Ensure all choice prompts have "🔔 YOUR RESPONSE NEEDED"
6. Verify box widths are exactly 60 characters
7. Standardize bullet vs dash in "What's Next" sections
8. Final consistency pass across all 10 files

Warnings (context-aware filtering, collaborative error recovery examples) can be addressed post-ship as enhancements.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix BLOCKER violations** (1-2 hours) - Required for ship
2. **Address WARNING violations** (2-3 hours) - Recommended before ship
3. **Consider SUGGESTION enhancements** (future work) - Nice to have

The semgrep warning is a non-issue (certificate configuration, not a security problem).

**Review conducted with**:
- `.hodge/standards.md` (project standards)
- `.hodge/review-profiles/ux-patterns/claude-code-slash-commands.yaml` (UX pattern profile)
- `.hodge/patterns/README.md` (pattern philosophy)
- Quality check output from automated tools

This review demonstrates the importance of loading and APPLYING context files, not just reading them. My initial review missed these UX violations because I only looked at automated tool output without actually reviewing the content against the loaded UX profile. Thank you for calling that out!
