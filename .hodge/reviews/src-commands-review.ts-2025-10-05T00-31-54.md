# Code Review Report: src/commands/review.ts

**Profile**: Default Code Quality
**Reviewed**: October 5, 2025, 12:26 AM UTC

## Blockers (0)

No blocker-level issues found.

## Warnings (2)

### 1. TODO Comments Without Phase Marker
- **Location**: src/commands/review.ts:60
- **Description**: TODO comment exists but doesn't follow the standard format `// TODO: [phase] description`
- **Rationale**: Per Code Comments and TODOs standard: "Always use `// TODO:` comments for incomplete work. Format: `// TODO: [phase] description`". The comment should indicate which phase the work should be completed in.
- **Suggested Action**: `/explore "Update TODO comment format in review.ts to include phase marker"`

### 2. Incomplete Implementation - Placeholder Logic
- **Location**: src/commands/review.ts:60-77
- **Description**: The execute() method contains extensive placeholder logic with comments explaining what "will" happen rather than actual implementation. The file is read (line 47) but immediately suppressed, and the method outputs informational messages instead of performing actual review.
- **Rationale**: While this is acceptable during build/harden phases as noted in the previous review (HODGE-327.1 was a template-only change), the TODO comments and placeholder messages indicate this CLI command is incomplete and doesn't integrate with the slash command template yet.
- **Suggested Action**: `/explore "Complete CLI-to-slash-command integration for review command"`

## Suggestions (3)

### 1. Error Message Could Reference Profile Path
- **Location**: src/commands/review.ts:31
- **Description**: Error message says "Please ensure .hodge/review-profiles/default.yml exists" but doesn't show the actual profile name that was attempted (`default` is hardcoded on line 28)
- **Rationale**: If profile loading becomes configurable in the future, the error message would be misleading
- **Suggested Action**: Consider using `Please ensure .hodge/review-profiles/${profileName}.yml exists` for future-proofing

### 2. Unused Variable With Unclear Intent
- **Location**: src/commands/review.ts:47-48
- **Description**: Variable `_fileContent` is read but immediately voided with an explanatory comment. While the underscore prefix correctly indicates it's unused, this pattern is unusual for placeholder logic.
- **Rationale**: The comment explains it's a placeholder for HODGE-327.2+, but leaving a variable assignment that does nothing creates code that must be maintained unnecessarily
- **Suggested Action**: Consider removing the file read entirely until HODGE-327.2, or wrapping in a feature flag check

### 3. Console Output Could Use Consistent Formatting
- **Location**: src/commands/review.ts:51-80
- **Description**: Mix of emoji prefixes (üîç, üìã, ‚úÖ), markdown-style formatting (`**File**:`), and plain text. Some lines have emoji, some don't.
- **Rationale**: Consistent formatting improves readability and maintains professional CLI output standards
- **Suggested Action**: Standardize on either emoji + plain text or chalk colors throughout
