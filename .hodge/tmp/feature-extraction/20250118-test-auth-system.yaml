  decisions:
    - text: "Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication"
      date: "2025-01-18"
    - text: "Implement role-based access control (RBAC)"

    - text: "Add refresh token rotation for security"
      date: "2025-01-17"

  rationale: |
    These three decisions all relate to the authentication and authorization layer.
    They form a coherent unit because:
    - JWT provides the authentication mechanism
    - RBAC provides the authorization framework
    - Refresh tokens enhance the security of the JWT implementation
    Together they create a complete auth solution.

  exploration_areas:
    - area: "Token Strategy"
      questions:
        - "What should be the JWT expiration time?"
        - "Should we use symmetric or asymmetric signing?"
        - "How to handle token revocation?"

    - area: "RBAC Design"
      questions:
        - "Should roles be hierarchical or flat?"
        - "How granular should permissions be?"
        - "Dynamic vs static role assignment?"

    - area: "Security Considerations"
      questions:
        - "How to detect and prevent token replay attacks?"
        - "Should we implement rate limiting?"
        - "How to handle concurrent refresh token requests?"

  risks:
    - "JWT tokens can't be invalidated without blacklisting"
    - "Token size might exceed header limits with many permissions"
    - "Refresh token rotation complexity"
