  rationale: |
    These decisions form a coherent feature around the extraction workflow.
    The YAML spec provides structure, metadata preserves context, and
    user modification ensures accuracy.

  scope:
    included:
      - 'YAML specification loading'
      - 'Metadata preservation in exploration files'
      - 'User review workflow'
    excluded:
      - 'Automatic extraction without review'
      - 'Binary format support'

  dependencies:
    - 'js-yaml'
    - 'fs-extra'

  exploration_areas:
    - area: 'Error Handling'
      questions:
        - 'How to handle malformed YAML?'
        - 'What if required fields are missing?'
    - area: 'User Experience'
      questions:
        - 'How to present extracted features for review?'
        - 'Should we support batch extraction?'
