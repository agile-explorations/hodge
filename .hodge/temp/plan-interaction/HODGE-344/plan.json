Supports filtering quality checks to scoped files where tools allow it, documenting which tools run project-wide.

Implements review-first workflow sequence (manifest → AI review → interactive fix selection → optional auto-fix). Full integration with ReviewEngineService configured for file-based mode (no critical selection, reports to .hodge/reviews/, non-intrusive auto-fix).",
