    "edited": "feat: implement two-layer toolchain configuration architecture (HODGE-341.2)\n\n## What Changed\n\n**Core Infrastructure** (5 files, 248 lines):\n- src/bundled-config/tool-registry.yaml: Updated default commands with correct parameters\n  - TypeScript: Added `-p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit ${files}`\n  - Vitest: Added `NODE_ENV=test npx vitest run --reporter=dot`\n  - jscpd: Added `--min-lines 10` flag to reduce noise\n  - dependency-cruiser: Added `--config .dependency-cruiser.cjs ${files}`\n  - eslint-plugin-sonarjs: Changed from `null` to `npx eslint ${files}`\n\n- src/lib/toolchain-generator.ts: Extended to handle all 9 quality check categories\n  - Added: complexity, code_smells, duplication, architecture, security\n  - Refactored category mapping to use switch statement for maintainability\n  - Used non-null assertions for TypeScript strict mode compliance\n\n- src/lib/toolchain-service.ts: Enhanced quality checks execution\n  - Extended runQualityChecks() to run all 9 check types\n  - Fixed version detection regex to prevent ReDoS vulnerability\n  - Improved error handling and logging\n\n- src/lib/harden-service.ts: Captured all quality check results\n  - Added private typed field for lastQualityCheckResults\n  - Removed unsafe `any` types (TypeScript strict mode compliance)\n  - Added getter method for command layer access\n\n- src/commands/harden.ts: Integrated quality checks reporting\n  - Added generateQualityChecksReport() method\n  - Writes comprehensive quality-checks.md with all tool outputs\n  - Reduced cognitive complexity via extractMethod refactoring\n\n**Command Refactoring** (2 files, 137 lines):\n- src/commands/build.ts: Extracted validatePrerequisites() method\n  - Reduced cognitive complexity from 21 to under 15\n  - Improved maintainability and readability\n\n- src/commands/harden.ts: Extracted setupHardenEnvironment() method\n  - Reduced cognitive complexity from 18 to under 15\n  - Added helper methods for test status formatting\n\n**Service Enhancement** (1 file, 69 lines):\n- src/lib/ship-service.ts: Added updateShipRecord() method\n  - Enables partial updates to ship-record.json\n  - Proper error handling with structured logging\n\n**Test Updates** (6 files, 74 lines):\n- Updated ship-record.json path from `ship/ship-record.json` to root-level\n- Fixed 14 test assertions for new ship-record location\n- Increased timeout for slow toolchain detection tests (5s → 10s)\n- All tests maintain proper isolation (no project .hodge modifications)\n\n**Configuration Updates** (2 files):\n- .hodge/toolchain.yaml: Added `--min-lines 10` to jscpd command\n- src/types/toolchain.ts: Enhanced with comprehensive quality check categories\n\n## Why This Change\n\nPhase 2 of HODGE-341 epic implements the two-layer toolchain configuration architecture:\n- **Layer 1 (Tool Registry)**: Hodge's universal tool knowledge with opinionated defaults\n- **Layer 2 (Project Toolchain)**: User-customizable commands for their project\n\nThis enables:\n- Proper tool detection and execution via registry-based patterns\n- All 9 quality check categories (not just 4) running in harden phase\n- Raw tool output capture for AI interpretation (HODGE-341.3)\n- Commit range scoping using buildStartCommit/hardenStartCommit\n- Scalable quality checks without hardcoded tool knowledge\n\n## Impact\n\n✅ **Architecture**:\n- Clean two-layer separation: registry defines defaults, toolchain customizes\n- CLI discovers structure, AI interprets content (HODGE-334 pattern)\n- Service-based design with proper type safety\n\n✅ **Code Quality**:\n- All 939 tests passing (no regressions)\n- Zero unsafe `any` types in HODGE-341.2 code\n- TypeScript strict mode compliance throughout\n- Reduced cognitive complexity in command files\n\n✅ **Developer Experience**:\n- `hodge init` generates toolchain.yaml with all 9 quality check categories\n- Quality checks report (quality-checks.md) provides comprehensive tool outputs\n- Better error messages and logging throughout\n- Proper separation of concerns (commands vs services)\n\n✅ **Quality Gates**:\n- 9 quality check types now running: type_checking, linting, testing, formatting, complexity, code_smells, duplication, architecture, security\n- Raw tool output preserved for AI review (HODGE-341.3)\n- Commit-scoped file checking for focused reviews\n\n**Pattern**: Two-layer configuration enables opinionated defaults with user customization, following the principle of \"sensible defaults, easy overrides.\"\n\n**Known Issues**: Pre-existing ESLint errors in codebase documented in .hodge/features/HODGE-341.2/KNOWN-ISSUES.md (159 errors from previous features, not introduced by HODGE-341.2)\n\nCloses HODGE-341.2",
